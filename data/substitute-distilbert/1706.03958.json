Learning then amounts to minimizing the regularized training risk over a chosen parametric model family. However, this view obstructs the fact that the ultimate goal is in minimizing the expected risk on unseen data and that the regularized empirical risk serves merely as a proxy for the former. Optimization for machine learning is thus by design a quest for approximate solutions. This offers learning-specific tradeoffs between statistical accuracy and computational complexity, such as early stopping [22], convex relaxation [4], data sub-sampling [7], or accepting locally optimal solutions as in deep learning [6, 21]. Whereas optimization algorithms are often analyzed in terms of their convergence to the optimum, in learning the interest should primarily be on how quickly one can find suboptimal solutions of sufficient quality (relative to the size of the data sample).\nOne key question in this context is what initialization strategy to use for the weights of a model, as the initial parameter choice has a huge impact on the transient phase of iterative learning algorithms. There are many examples that clearly demonstrate that initialization matters, for instance in deep learning via weight transfer [23], data-dependent initialization [15], or in avoidance of saddle points [16]. The same is true for unsupervised learning problems like matrix completion [14] orK-means [2]. Notably, for convex learning, the role of initialization has been somewhat neglected, mainly because of the guaranteed convergence to the global optimum. However, for massive data sets, initialization can have a huge practical impact on the scalability of an algorithm. Moreover, the (easier) convex setting also allows for a more rigorous analysis of the effect of initialization and the reasons for the slow-down caused by poor starting points. In this vein, the current paper provides a detailed analysis of convex learning, specifically of ridge regression and generalized linear models, that suggests to pre-train models with artificially increased regularization and to use this as an initialization in the spirit of homotopy or continuation methods [1, 18]. The focus of our work is on the dual problem, because it offers more flexibility in the data representation (i.e. through the use of kernels), allows for fast algorithms like stochastic coordinate descent [20] that exhibit linear convergence and is\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 95\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n3 Ju\nn 20\nalso amenable to data sharding and communication-efficient distributed implementations [13].

Given a training set of n observations (xi, yi), with inputs xi \u2208 Rd and reponses yi \u2208 R, we denote by X \u2208 Rn\u00d7d the data matrix and by y \u2208 Rn the response vector. Let us assume w.l.o.g that y is mean zero and unit variance and that the data is centered.The ridge regression objective with regularization \u00b5 > 0, can be expressed as\nQ(\u03b2) = 1 2 \u03b2>H\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2>b, H := 1 n X>X + \u00b5I \u2208 Rd\u00d7d, b := 1 n X>y \u2208 Rd (1)\nThe optimal solution is explicitly given by the normal equations\n\u2207\u03b2Q ! = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b2\u2217 = H\u22121b = ( X>X + n\u00b5I )\u22121 X>y .

In particular note that bj = E[XjY ] is the covariance between the j-th feature dimension and the response.

(4)\nFor the diagonalized quadratic objective, the iterate sequence is explicitly given as follows. Lemma 1. GD initialized at \u03b20 yields the iterate sequence\n\u03b2t = \u03b2\u2217 + (I\u2212 \u03b3\u039b)t (\u03b20 \u2212 \u03b2\u2217) (5) Corollary 2. For any \u03b3 < 2\u03bb\u221211 and initial \u03b20, the iterate sequence generated by GD is guaranteed to converge to \u03b2\u2217 at a linear rate. Corollary 3. Define the condition number as \u03ba := \u03bb1/\u03bbd. The rate of parameter convergence of \u03b2d is lower bounded by 1\u2212 \u03b3\u03bbd > 1\u2212 2/\u03ba.\nOur interest is in the convergence of the objective value. We can easily (and exactly) relate distance in parameter space to suboptimality through \u039b. Lemma 4. Let \u03b2\u2217 be the minimizer of (1) and Q\u2217 , Q(\u03b2\u2217).

(6)\nLet us compare the worst case rate we would expect based on \u03ba in Corollary 3 with the empirical suboptimality of the GD iterate sequence on some (randomly selected) data sets. The plots in Figure 1 show that initially (and for the relevant transient phase) the observed reduction of suboptimality is typically much better than what may be expected based on the convergence rates in parameter space.

In an asymptotic setting, only the first would matter, leading to the well-known slow-down in convergence of GD for ill-conditioned problems, in directions where \u03b3\u03bbj becomes very small. But what if we can tolerate some suboptimality ? Then we could try to find an initialization such that the second term would be less than . There could be two cases: (i) we devise a smart strategy to find a good \u03b20 that is sufficiently close to \u03b2\u2217, (ii) we set \u03b20 = 0, but can reasonably assume that \u03b2\u2217 is small. We come back to (i) and first investigate (ii) by noting that\nQ(0)\u2212Q\u2217 = 1 2\nE[Y Zj ] 2\nE\u00b5[Z2i ] \u2264 1 2\nE[Y Zj ] 2\nE[Z2j ] =\n1 2 \u03c12j . (8)\nHere \u03c1j is the correlation coefficient between Y and the eigenfeature Zj . We now formulate the following hypothesis: the observed empirical sub-optimality of GD iterates is due to the fact that eigenfeatures Zj with small variance also have a small correlation with the response Y . This seems to be related to a similar assumption made in early stopping [22] and in general when using norm-based regularization: we do not want to trust features that need to be amplified a lot (low variance, but high output covariance). Hence, a reasonable feature representation should avoid encoding relevant information in such a manner. What we show here though is that such considerations not only avoid overfitting, but also accelerate GD training.\nIn order to subject this idea to a more formal treatment, let us introduce a suitable regularity concept. A dataset exhibits \u03c4 -bounded response correlation, if for any eigen-feature Zj with non-zero variance\n\u03c12j = E[Y Zj ]\n2\nE[Z2j ] \u2264 \u03c4E[Z2j ] = \u03c4\u03c32j (9)\nWith this definition, we can immediately see that we can upper bound the suboptimality of GD iterates by making use of the regularity parameter for all eigenfeatures with E[Z2j ] \u2264 \u03b6, where \u03b6 is an arbitrary threshold. Effectively, \u03c4 -boundedness allows us to pay a constant approximation cost for eigenfeatures with small variance and to trade that off with the faster rates obtained for the remaining eigenfeatures. We capture the gist of this effect in the following lemma.\nLemma 5. Assume that the data set has \u03c4 -bounded response correlation. Then for any \u03b6 \u2265 0, the suboptimality of the GD iterate sequence can be upper bounded as\nQ(\u03b2t)\u2212Q\u2217 \u2264 1 2\n[ r(\u03b6)(1\u2212 \u03b3\u03b6)2t + (d\u2212 r(\u03b6)) ] \u03c4\u03b6, r(\u03b6) := {j : E[Z2j ] > \u03b6} (10)\nProof. Follows directly from the boundedness assumptions.\nFigure 2 shows that our notion of regularity seems to agree well with the empirical observations that we pointed out before. Note that regularization increases the variance of eigenfeatures and thus leads to more favorable \u03c4 -bounds. However, for clarity, we wanted to capture this notion for the worst case of \u00b5 = 0."}, {"heading": "3 Dual Ridge Regression", "text": "We will now consider the dual problem for ridge regression.

This means that we have at least (n\u2212 d) orthogonal directions with a variance of 1/n accounting for a total variance of (n\u2212 d)/n. While in the primal case, there are at most d terms to bound and typically \u00b5 \u221d 1/n, in the dual we may get a suboptimality contribution that is O(1), even under a \u03c4 -boundedness assumption.\nSimilar to the primal objective, we use (to carry out the analysis, not the optimization!) the following change of variables \u03b1\u2190 U>\u03b1. This change of variables leads to the following diagonalization of the dual objective:\nQ\u00b5(\u03b1) = 1 2 \u03b1>\u0393\u03b1\u2212 c>\u03b1, n\u0393 := 1 \u00b5 \u03a3>\u03a3 + I, c := 1 n U>y, \u03b1\u2217\u00b5 = 1 n \u0393\u22121c (12)\nand suboptimality can be written as\nQ\u00b5(\u03b1)\u2212Q\u00b5(\u03b1\u2217\u00b5) = 1\n2n d\u2211 i=1 \u03bbi \u00b5 (\u03b1i \u2212\u03b1\u2217i ) 2 + 1 2n n\u2211 i=d+1 (\u03b1i \u2212\u03b1\u2217i ) 2 (13)\nIndeed, suboptimality can be decomposed to two terms: the suboptimality in image of the data matrix (the first sum), and the suboptimality in the kernel of the data matrix (the second sum).\nLemma 6. Suppose that \u03b1\u2217\u03bd is the minimizer of Q\u03bd , then for all \u03bd, \u00b5 > 0:\n\u03b1\u2217\u03bdj = \u03b1 \u2217\u00b5 j (\u2200j > d) and (\u03b1 \u2217\u03bd i \u2212\u03b1 \u2217\u00b5 i ) 2 = n\n( (\u00b5\u2212 \u03bd)\u03c32i\n(\u03c32i + \u00b5)(\u03c3 2 i + \u03bd)\n)2 E[Y Zi] 2 (14)\nProof. Follows directly from the closed form solution of minimizers.\nThe above lemma shows that (n \u2212 d) coefficients of two dual solutions with respect to different regularizer are exactly the same and the squared difference between other d coefficients is propotional to (\u00b5\u2212 \u03bd)2. Computing the minimizer \u03b1\u2217\u03bd is relatively cheaper than \u03b1\u2217\u00b5 for \u03bd \u00b5 as rates often depend on the strong convexity parameter. Hence we suggest initializing gradient descent for Q\u00b5 with \u03b1\u2217\u03bd for a suitably chosen \u03bd.\nLemma 7. Suppose that the data set has \u03c4 -bounded response correlations. Then for any \u03b6 \u2265 1n , the suboptimality of the GD iterates starting from \u03b1\u2217\u03bd with step size (n\u00b5)\u03b3 can be upper bounded as\nQ(\u03b1t)\u2212Q\u2217 \u2264 \u03c4\u03b6(\u03bd \u2212 \u00b5) 2\n2\u03bd\u00b5\n[ r(\u03b6)(1\u2212 \u03b3\u03b6)2t + (d\u2212 r(\u03b6)) ] , r(\u03b6) := |{j : E[Z2j ] > \u03b6}| (15)\nProof. Plugging the result of lemma 6 into suboptimality of the dual objective in Eq. (13) concludes the proof.\nThe above result closely mirrors Lemma 5 with the addition of a factor that depends on the chosen \u03bd (in relation to \u00b5). A smaller homotopic parameter \u03bd \u2013 closer to \u00b5 \u2013 enjoys the convergence with a smaller scaling factor (\u03bd \u2212 \u00b5)2/(\u03bd\u00b5). However, computing the initial vector \u03b2\u2217\u03bd is more expensive for a small \u03bd. Setting that aside, the significance of the homotopic initialization is the fact that the (n\u2212 d) directions of eigenvalue n\u22121 do no longer have en effect on the suboptimality. Note that in the eigensystem of Eq. (12), we can easily solve (irrespective of \u00b5)\n\u03b1\u2217j = u > j y min\u2190\u2212 1 2n \u03b12j \u2212 cj\u03b1j , (\u2200j > d) (16)\nHowever, this is not a practical computation as the basis vectors uj of the kernel of X are not known and the eigen-parameterization is not the one accessible to the algorithm. The trick of the homotopic initialization is that effectively we set \u03b1\u2217j , without having to perform the diagonalization of X >X."}, {"heading": "3.2 Accelerated RCDM by Homotopic Initialization", "text": "In the large scale setting (when the sample size n is large), the gradient step is computationally expensive. Random coordinate descent method (RCDM) [19, 20] is computationally more attractive than GD and offers a competitive convergence. A RCD-step is obtained by a coordinate-wise approximation of the gradient. More precisely, it randomly picks a random coordinate r \u2208 {1, . . . , n} and updates it using the corresponding coordinate of the gradient (denoted by Q\u2032r(\u00b7)) as\n\u03b1+r = \u03b1r \u2212 \u03b3rQ\u2032r(\u03b1), (17)\nwhere \u03b3r is the coordinate-wise step size of RCDM. We ask if homotopic initialization also accelerates the convergence \u2013 up to a suboptimal solution. The convergence dependency on initialization is more subtle in a stochastic setting, where each optimization step is perturbed by the noise of the gradient approximation. Here, we theoretically prove that homotopic initialization accelerates RCDM. To this end, we provide a different convergence analysis for RCDM on the dual objective of ridge regression. Later, we will show how this result provides a better convergence rate in the objective using homotopic initialization. Theorem 8. Let Gi,j denote the (i, j)-th element of the Hessian matrix G.

Using coordinate-wise step sizes of Eq. (18), the classical analysis of RCDM [19] suggests the rate 1\u2212 (n+ 2B/\u00b5)\u22121, while our analysis improves the rate by a factor of \u03c1/n > 1 to 1\u2212 (\u03c1/n)(n+ 2B/\u00b5)\u22121. This improvement is not only with respect to the strong-convexity factor \u00b5 (e.g., as in the catalyst method [17]), but also with respect to the sample\nsize n. The acceleration of Theorem 8 is up to a suboptimal solution: either the norm of the gradient is bounded by O(\u03c12\u2016\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217\u20162) or the suboptimality is at most O(\u03c1\u2016\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217\u20162). Both the suboptimality bounds highly depend on the initial Euclidean distance to the minimizer. In fact, one can take advantage of the accelerated rate only if the initial distance \u2016\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217\u20162 is small. We observed that this distance is significantly large for initialization with the all-zero vector. Nonetheless, we theoretically bound this distance for homotopic initialization. Lemma 9. Assume that the data set has \u03c4 -bounded response correlation. Then for any \u03b6 the distance between two minimizers of the dual objective with different regularizers is bounded as\n\u2016\u03b1\u2217\u03bd \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u00b5\u20162 \u2264 ( (\u00b5\u2212 \u03bd)2/\u03bd ) (d\u2212 r(\u03b6))n\u03c4\u03b6. (21)\nLemma 9 implies that for a smaller \u03bd, closer to \u00b5, the initial distance is smaller and hence the acceleration of homotopic initialization is up to a better suboptimality. However, convergence to \u03b1\u2217\u03bd is slower as it directly relates to the \u03bd. In our experiments, we observed that setting \u03bd = 1 4 \u221a \u00b5 \u2013 which is considerably cheaper than computing the minimizer \u03b1\u2217\u00b5\u2013 provides a significant acceleration. The coordinate-wise step sizes of Eq. (18) are quite pessimistic. In our experiments, we used larger step sizes \u03b3r = G\u22121r,r , which is equal to the coordinate-wise Lipschitz constants [19] of the dual ridge objective."}, {"heading": "4 Generalized Linear Model", "text": "The accelerated convergence for an approximate solution also applies to generalised linear models.

This observation justifies the effectiveness of one of the most common initialization schemes of deep neural networks: Use resulting weights of a trained shallow network to initialize a deep neural network [10]. We attribute the gain of such initialization to the boundedness of features obtained by a smaller network. Suppose that we used a trained network with N \u2212 1 layer to initialize the first N \u2212 1 layers of a larger network (assume that the number of hidden units is the same as the number of output unites). If we freeze weights of the first N \u2212 1 layers, then optimization with respect to weights of the last layer is a convex programming task using a convex loss function, which can be modelled by a generalized linear model. Since features obtained by a trained network are \u03c4 -bounded, we expect an initial acceleration of GD by initialising the last layer to all-zero. In practice, we do not need to freeze weights of early layers because back propagation naturally causes small changes in early layers due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon [11]. Furthermore, we do not need to increase the number of layers by one. In our experiments, we have observed that even a network with N/2 layers yields a good initialization for a network with N layers (see figure 4). Since optimization of shallow networks is relatively cheaper than a deep neural network, this initialization is relatively cheap to compute. Our argument can also be extended to the layer-wise training for deep neural networks [3]. Indeed, the boundedness property is a statistical property of a representation that plays an important role in optimization for machine learning."}, {"heading": "6 Experimental Results", "text": "6.1 Datasets and Protocol\nIn this section, we present our empirical results on real datasets, selected from LIBSVM library [5] (see Table 1 for more details). We measured the boundedness constant \u03c4 for these datasets, which is used in our analysis. The regularizer is \u00b5 = 10\u22126 for all datasets except for GISETTE, which has relatively less samples, and hence we used regularizer \u00b5 = 10\u22123."}, {"heading": "6.2 Initialization for Dual Objective", "text": "We ran an experiment to assess the advantage of the homotopic initialization on dual programming. Our experiment is on initialization of Random Coordinate Descent Method (RCDM) for optimizing the dual objective of ridge regression. Throughout all the experiments, we used the homotopic parameter \u03bd = 0.25 \u221a \u00b5, which is computationally a favourable choice. We used coordinate-wise step sizes \u03b3r = G\u22121r,r , which are equal coordinate-wise Lipchitz constants and its a common choice for RCDM [19]. Our sampling scheme of coordinates is random permutation in each epoch. Figure 3 shows the dual suboptimality, primal suboptimality, and test error through optimization. To compute the primal suboptimality, we mapped the dual parameter to the primal one using the mapping \u03b2(t) = (n\u00b5)\u22121X\u03b1(t) (used in [20]). This mapping obtains the primal minimizer given the dual minimizer, i.e. \u03b2\u2217 = (n\u00b5)\u22121X\u03b1\u2217 holds. For the test error, we computed the average of the squared loss on the test data. Overall, we observe that the homotopic initialization causes a worse initial primal and dual suboptimality compared to the initialization with all-zero vector. Nonetheless, the suboptimality decays quickly and reachs a better suboptimality compared to the initialization with zero. Indeed, the homotopic initial vector lies in the space of coarser eigen-features (features associated with larger eigenvalues) that accelerates optimization. Although the accelerated convergence is up to a suboptimal solution, this suboptimal solution achieves a test error that is comparable to the test error of the empirical minimizer on most of datasets. The acceleration, obtained by the homotopic initialization, is related to the boundedness factor \u03c4 of the dataset reported in table 1. For example, the homotopic initialization on GISETTE, which has a large \u03c4 , obtains relatively less gain.\nAlthough our analysis of homotopic initialization was limited to the ridge regression problem, our experiments on dual SVM show the same behaviour for this initialization. Our results on dual SVM are included in the appendix."}, {"heading": "6.3 Initialization for neural networks", "text": "We ran an experiment to highlight the role of boundedness of a representation in the convergence speed of gradient descent on neural networks.

Here, we compared the boundedness of features obtained from the last layer of the network before and after training. Our observations show that a trained neural network provides boundedness (see figures 4.a and 4.b). Based on this observation, we use a layer-wise initialization strategy. We trained a MLP with 5 layers and the same number of hidden units. Then we initialized the first 5 layers of the main network (with 10 layers) by the trained weights of the smaller network and we set the rest of weights to zero.We compared the convergence of GD with step size 0.1 using these two different initialisation schemes.

In this section, we extend the result to the random coordinate descent method. For gradient descent, iterates could be tracked in a closed form, and the role of the initialisation was closely reflected in the convergence. The analysis of random coordinate descent, however, is more involved due to the noisy estimation of the gradient. In the next lemma, we decompose the convergence bound of RCDM to two terms: a term that depends on the initial sub-optimality on the dual objective, the second term is determined by the initial Euclidean distance to the dual minimizer. Later, we will use this result to prove that homotopic initialization provides an acceleration up to a suboptimal. Theorem (8). Let Gi,j denote the (i, j)-element of the Hessian matrix G.

We rewrite the RCDM update in a form that facilitates our future analysis. Consider matrix \u03a8r whose r-th diagonal element is one and remaining elements are zero; using this matrix, RCDM step can be written as\n\u03b1+ = \u03b1\u2212 \u03b3r\u03a8rQ\u2032(\u03b1) = \u03b1\u2212 \u03b3r\u03a8r (Q\u2032(\u03b1)\u2212Q\u2032(\u03b1\u2217)) = (I\u2212 \u03b3r\u03a8rG)(\u03b1\u2212\u03b1\u2217) + \u03b1\u2217. (29)\nNote that we used the optimality condition of \u03b1\u2217 in the second step. We skipped the subscript \u00b5 for Q\u00b5 throughout the proof. To obtain the desired convergence guarantee, we decompose the Hessian matrix, of the dual objective, as G = L\u03c1 + S\u03c1 where matrices L\u03c1 and S\u03c1 are obtained from SVD decomposition of the data matrix:\nL\u03c1 = (n\u00b5)\u22121 \u2211 i:\u03bbi\u2265\u03c1 \u03bbiuiu > i (30)\nS\u03c1 = (n\u00b5)\u22121 \u2211 j:\u03bbj<\u03c1 \u03bbjuju > j . (31)\nThe second smallest eigenvalue of the L\u03c1 is \u03c1, the spectral norm of S\u03c1 is bounded by \u03c1, and L\u03c1S\u03c1 = 0. Using the above decomposition, the expected suboptimality after one RCD-step can be written as\nEr [ Q(\u03b1+)\u2212Q\u2217 ] (6) = 1 2 E [ \u2016\u03b1+ \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u2016G ] = 1\n2 E [ \u2016\u03b1+ \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u2016L\u03c1 ] + 1 2 E [ \u2016\u03b1+ \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u2016S\u03c1 ] (32)\nWe prove that the first term, which depends on directions with large eigenvalues, decays in a favourable rate (in lemma 11) and the second term is bounded (by a factor of the threshold \u03c1).\nLemma 11.

It remains to show that T2 is negative:\nT2 = E [ \u2206> ( \u03b32rG\u03a8rL\u03c1\u03a8rG\u2212 \u03b3rL\u03c1\u03a8rG ) \u2206 ]\n[1] = E [ \u2206> ( L\u03c1,r\u03b32rG\u03a8rG\u2212 \u03b3rL\u03c1\u03a8rG ) \u2206 ]\n[2] = E [ \u03b3r\u2206 > (GrG\u03a8rG\u2212 L\u03c1\u03a8rG) \u2206 ]\n[3] \u2264 \u03b3minE [ \u2206> ( 1\n2 G\u03a8rG\u2212 L\u03c1\u03a8rG\n) \u2206 ] \u2264 \u03b3min\u2206> ( 1\n2 GE [\u03a8r]G\u2212 L\u03c1E [\u03a8r]G\n) \u2206\n[4] \u2264 \u03b3min n\n\u2206> ( 1\n2 G2 \u2212 L\u03c1G\n) \u2206\n[5] \u2264 \u03b3min 2\n\u2206> ( S2\u03c1 \u2212 L2\u03c1 ) \u2206\n[6] \u2264 0 (40)\nwhere we used following facts in each step:\n[1]: Note that L\u03c1,r denotes the diagonal element r of matrix L\u03c1. Matrix \u03a8r has only one non-zero element: the r-th diagonal which is one, hence \u03a8rL\u03c1\u03a8r = L\u03c1,r\u03a8r .\n[2]: Recall (L = G\u2212S)\u2192 (L\u03c1,r = Gr \u2212S\u03c1,r). Since S\u03c1 is positive definite, its diagonal elements are positive.

To prove this, we write the norm of the gradient as:\n\u2016Q\u2032(\u03b1)\u20162 = \u2016Q\u2032(\u03b1)\u2212Q\u2032(\u03b1\u2217)\u20162\n= \u2016G\u2206\u20162\n= \u2016L\u03c1\u2206\u20162 + \u2016S\u03c1\u2206\u20162 (41) Now the condition of Eq.

It remains to prove that the second term of suboptimality, i.e. E [ \u2016\u03b1+ \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u2016S\u03c1 ] , scales with a factor of \u03c1:\nE [ \u2016\u03b1+ \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162S\u03c1 ] \u2264 \u2016S\u03c1\u2016E [ \u2016\u03b1+ \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162 ] \u2264 \u03c1E [ \u2016\u03b1+ \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162 ] . (43)\nLet parameter vector \u03b1(t) denote the obtained parameter vector after t RCDM steps. We know that RCMD with step size of \u03b3r \u2264 (Gr,r)\u22121 monotonically convergences to the minimizer in terms of the objective value. Furthermore, (1/n)-strong convexity of the dual function implies that \u2016\u03b1(t) \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162 \u2264 n(Q(t) \u2212Q\u2217). Therefore, \u2016\u03b1(t) \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u2016 asymptotically convergences to zero; however, this convergence is not monotone. In other words, the distance might diverge. In the next lemma, we bound this distance by a factor of the initial distance, i.e. \u2016\u03b10 \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162.\nLemma 12. The distance of RCD iterates \u03b1(t) from the minimizer are bounded by a constant factor of the initial distance from the minimizer:\nE\u2016\u03b1(t) \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162 \u2264 \u03b3min \u03b3max \u2016\u03b1(0) \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162 (44)\nfor the choice of step sizes in Eq.

Furthermore, the choice of step sizes of Eq. (26) ensures matrix \u039b \u2212G is diagonal dominant, therefore it is positive definite. Using these facts, we prove that E\u2016\u03b1(t) \u2212\u03b1\u2217\u20162\u039b does not diverge.

The Hessian matrix of R highly depends on the covariance matrix of the distribution of input:\nR\u2032\u2032(z) = E [ \u03d5(2)(x>z) ] \u03a3 + E [ \u03d5(3)(x>i z)x ] z>\u03a3 (52)\n[Stien\u2019s lemma] = E [ \u03d5(2)(x>z) ] \u03a3 + E [ \u03d5(4)(x>z) ] \u03a3zz>\u03a3. (53)\nUsing the above the Hessian and the gradient, we provide a useful expression of the gradient that facilitates the our convergence analysis. Lemma 13. There exists constants \u03be1, and \u03be2, which depend on z, and z\u2217 such that R\u2032(z) = \u03be1\u03a3(z\u2212 z\u2217) + \u03be2Eyx [yx] (54) holds.\nProof. According to mean-value theorem, there is a z\u0304 = (1\u2212 \u03b8)z + \u03b8z\u2217, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) such that R\u2032(z)\u2212R\u2032(z\u2217) = R\u2032\u2032(z\u0304)(z\u2212 z\u2217) (55)\n(52) = E [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u0304) ] \u03a3(z\u2212 z\u2217) + E [ \u03d5(4)(x>z\u0304) ] \u03a3z\u0304 ( z\u0304>\u03a3(z\u2212 z\u2217) ) (56)\n= E [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u0304) ] \u03a3(z\u2212 z\u2217) + c1\u03a3z\u0304 (57)\n= c2\u03a3(z\u2212 z\u2217) + c1\u03a3z (58) (50) = c2\u03a3(z\u2212 z\u2217) + c3 (R\u2032(z) + Ex,y [yx]) , (59)\nwhere constants are\nc1 = E [ \u03d5(4)(x>z\u0304) ] ( z\u0304>\u03a3(z\u2212 z\u2217) ) (60)\nc2 = E [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u0304) ] \u2212 \u03b8c1 (61)\nc3 = c1\n( E [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u0304) ])\u22121 . (62)\nThe Eq. 59 with the optimality conditionR\u2032(z\u2217) = 0 conclude the proof for \u03be1 = c2/(1\u2212 c3), and \u03be2 = c3/(1\u2212 c3).\nA biased gradient step We suggest our modified gradient step as\nz(t) = z(t\u22121) \u2212 \u03b3tR\u2032(z(t\u22121))\u2212 \u03b7tE [yx] (63) where constant \u03b3t and \u03b7t are two step sizes. In the next lemma, we prove that the convergence of such a modified gradient descent depends on the covariance matrix of the distribution. Lemma 14. Let iterate z(t) is obtained by t GD steps on GLM. There is a schedule for \u03b3t and \u03b7t such that modified GD steps can be written as\nz(t+1) \u2212 z\u2217 = (I\u2212 \u03a3/L) ( z(t) \u2212 z\u2217 ) , (64)\nwhere L = \u2016\u03a3\u2016.\nProof. We prove the above bound by induction on t.\nz(t+1) \u2212 z\u2217 = z(t) \u2212 z\u2217 \u2212 \u03b3tR\u2032(z(t))\u2212 \u03b7tE [yx] (65) Lemma 13\n= z(t) \u2212 z\u2217 \u2212 \u03b3t\u03be1\u03a3(z(t) \u2212 z\u2217)\u2212 \u03b3t\u03be2E [yx]\u2212 \u03b7tE [yx] (66) The above equation with step size \u03b3t = (L\u03be1)\u22121 and \u03b7 = \u2212\u03b3t\u03be2 completes the proof. holds. Replacing the above equation in the convergence bound with the step size \u03b3t = (LEx [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u0304(t)) ] )\u22121 concludes the proof.\nAlthough the last lemma does not specify step sizes, one can find this schedule by line-search. The result allows us to track iterates of GD in a closed form, which provides an accelerated convergence up to a suboptimal solution for GLM \u2013 similar to ridge regression. The next lemma proves this. Lemma (10). Suppose that inputs are drawn i.i.d from a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix \u03a3, i.e. xi \u223c N(~0,\u03a3) where \u2016\u03a3\u2016 = L. Assume that |\u03d5(2)(a)| \u2264 \u03c6. If the dataset is \u03c4 -bounded, then there is a step size schedule for modified gradient descent such that iterates of GD starting from zero obtains the following suboptimality bound for all 0 < \u03b6 < L:\nR(z(t))\u2212R\u2217 \u2264 cz\u2217\u03c4\u03c6 ( (1\u2212 \u03b6/L)2t (1\u2212 r(\u03b6)) + r(\u03b6)\u03b6 ) , (67)\nr(\u03b6) := |{j : E[Z2j ] > \u03b6}|, cz\u2217 := (Ex [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u2217) ] )\u22121. (68)\nProof. Using the mean-value theorem, there is z\u0304(t) = \u03b8z(t) + (1\u2212 \u03b8)z\u2217, \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1] such that\nR(z(t))\u2212R(z\u2217) = \u2016z(t) \u2212 z\u2217\u2016R\u2032\u2032(z\u0304(t)) (69) (52) = E [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u0304(t)) ] \u2016z(t) \u2212 z\u2217\u2016\u03a3 (70)\n\u2264 \u03c6\u2016z(t) \u2212 z\u2217\u2016\u03a3 (71) Lemma 14 \u2264 \u03c6\u2016(I\u2212 \u03a3/L)t ( z(0) \u2212 z\u2217 ) \u2016\u03a3 (72)\nIt remains to relate the z\u2217 to the boundedness assumption. To this end, we use optimality condition of z\u2217 as\nR\u2032(z\u2217) != 0 z\u2217 (50)= cz\u2217\u03a3\u22121E[xy], cz\u2217 := ( Ex [ \u03d5(2)(x>z\u2217) ])\u22121 (73)\nThe above result, which is also provided in [9], shows that the minimizer of the GLM can be obtained by scaling the minimizer of ridge regression. The convergence bound of Eq. (72) is also scaled convergence of the gradient descent on ridge regression. Plugging the minimizer into the Eq. (72) with the boundedness assumption completes the proof.\n7.3 Experiments"}], "references": [{"title": "Numerical continuation methods: an introduction, volume 13", "author": ["Eugene L Allgower",
