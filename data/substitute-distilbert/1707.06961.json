These low-dimensional embeddings are typically trained to capture distributional similarity, so that information can be shared among words that tend to appear in similar contexts.\nHowever, it is not possible to enumerate the entire vocabulary of any language, and even large unlabeled datasets will miss terms that appear in later applications. The issue of how to handle these out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words poses challenges for embedding-based methods. These challenges are particularly acute when working with lowresource languages, where even unlabeled data may be difficult to obtain at scale. A typical solution is to abandon hope, by assigning a single OOV embedding to all terms that do not appear in the unlabeled data.\nWe approach this challenge from a quasigenerative perspective. Knowing nothing of a word except for its embedding and its written form, we attempt to learn the former from the latter. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) on the character level with the embedding as the target, and use it later to predict vectors for OOV words in any downstream task. We call this model the MIMICK-RNN, for its ability to read a word\u2019s spelling and mimick its distributional embedding.\nThrough nearest-neighbor analysis, we show that vectors learned via this method capture both word-shape features and lexical features. As a result, we obtain reasonable near-neighbors for OOV abbreviations, names, novel compounds, and orthographic errors. Quantitative evaluation on the Stanford RareWord dataset (Luong et al., 2013) provides more evidence that these character-based embeddings capture word similarity for rare and unseen words.\nAs an extrinsic evaluation, we conduct experiments on joint prediction of part-of-speech tags and morphosyntactic attributes for a diverse set of 23 languages, as provided in the Universal Dependencies dataset (De Marneffe et al., 2014). Our model shows significant improvement\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n06 96\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nacross the board against a single UNK-embedding backoff method, and obtains competitive results against a supervised character-embedding model, which is trained end-to-end on the target task. In low-resource settings, our approach is particularly effective, and is complementary to supervised character embeddings trained from labeled data. The MIMICK-RNN therefore provides a useful new tool for tagging tasks in settings where there is limited labeled data. Models and code are available at www.github.com/ yuvalpinter/mimick ."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Compositional models for embedding rare and unseen words. Several studies make use of morphological or orthographic information when training word embeddings, enabling the prediction of embeddings for unseen words based on their internal structure. Botha and Blunsom (2014) compute word embeddings by summing over embeddings of the morphemes; Luong et al. (2013) construct a recursive neural network over each word\u2019s morphological parse; Bhatia et al. (2016) use morpheme embeddings as a prior distribution over probabilistic word embeddings. While morphology-based approaches make use of meaningful linguistic substructures, they struggle with names and foreign language words, which include out-of-vocabulary morphemes. Character-based approaches avoid these problems: for example, Kim et al. (2016) train a recurrent neural network over words, whose embeddings are constructed by convolution over character embeddings; Wieting et al. (2016) learn embeddings of character ngrams, and then sum them into word embeddings. In all of these cases, the model for composing embeddings of subword units into word embeddings is learned by optimizing an objective over a large unlabeled corpus. In contrast, our approach is a post-processing step that can be applied to any set of word embeddings, regardless of how they were trained. This is similar to the \u201cretrofitting\u201d approach of Faruqui et al. (2015), but rather than smoothing embeddings over a graph, we learn a function to build embeddings compositionally.\nSupervised subword models. Another class of methods learn task-specific character-based word embeddings within end-to-end supervised systems. For example, Santos and Zadrozny (2014) build word embeddings by convolution over char-\nacters, and then perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging using a local classifier; the tagging objective drives the entire learning process. Ling et al. (2015) propose a multi-level long shortterm memory (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), in which word embeddings are built compositionally from an LSTM over characters, and then tagging is performed by an LSTM over words. Plank et al. (2016) show that concatenating a character-level or bit-level LSTM network to a word representation helps immensely in POS tagging. Because these methods learn from labeled data, they can cover only as much of the lexicon as appears in their labeled training sets. As we show, they struggle in several settings: lowresource languages, where labeled training data is scarce; morphologically rich languages, where the number of morphemes is large, or where the mapping from form to meaning is complex; and in Chinese, where the number of characters is orders of magnitude larger than in non-logographic scripts. Furthermore, supervised subword models can be combined with MIMICK, offering additive improvements.\nMorphosyntactic attribute tagging. We evaluate our method on the task of tagging word tokens for their morphosyntactic attributes, such as gender, number, case, and tense. The task of morpho-syntactic tagging dates back at least to the mid 1990s (Oflazer and Kuruo\u0308z, 1994; Hajic\u030c and Hladka\u0301, 1998), and interest has been rejuvenated by the availability of large-scale multilingual morphosyntactic annotations through the Universal Dependencies (UD) corpus (De Marneffe et al., 2014). For example, Faruqui et al. (2016) propose a graph-based technique for propagating typelevel morphological information across a lexicon, improving token-level morphosyntactic tagging in 11 languages, using an SVM tagger. In contrast, we apply a neural sequence labeling approach, inspired by the POS tagger of Plank et al. (2016)."}, {"heading": "3 MIMICK Word Embeddings", "text": "We approach the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) embeddings as a generation problem: regardless of how the original embeddings were created, we assume there is a generative wordformbased protocol for creating these embeddings. By training a model over the existing vocabulary, we can later use that model for predicting the embedding of an unseen word.\nFormally: given a language L, a vocabulary V \u2286 L of size V , and a pre-trained embeddings table W \u2208 RV\u00d7d where each word {wk}Vk=1 is assigned a vector ek of dimension d, our model is trained to find the function f : L \u2192 Rd such that the projected function f |V approximates the assignments f(wk) \u2248 ek. Given such a model, a new word wk\u2217 \u2208 L \\ V can now be assigned an embedding ek\u2217 = f(wk\u2217).\nOur predictive function of choice is a Word Type Character Bi-LSTM. Given a word with character sequence w = {ci}n1 , a forward-LSTM and a backward-LSTM are run over the corresponding character embeddings sequence {e(c)i }n1 . Let hnf represent the final hidden vector for the forward-LSTM, and let h0b represent the final hidden vector for the backward-LSTM. The word embedding is computed by a multilayer perceptron:\n(1)f(w) = OT \u00b7 g(Th \u00b7 [hnf ;h0b ] + bh) + bT ,\nwhere Th, bh and OT , bT are parameters of affine transformations, and g is a nonlinear elementwise function. The model is presented in Figure 1.\nThe training objective is similar to that of Yin and Schu\u0308tze (2016).

The ultimate output of the training phase is the character embeddings matrix C and the parameters of the neural network: M = {C,F,B,Th, bh,OT , bT }, where F,B are the forward and backward LSTM component parameters, respectively."}, {"heading": "3.1 MIMICK Polyglot Embeddings", "text": "The pretrained embeddings we use in our experiments are obtained from Polyglot (Al-Rfou et al., 2013), a multilingual word embedding effort. Available for dozens of languages, each dataset contains 64-dimension embeddings for the 100,000 most frequent words in a language\u2019s training corpus (of variable size), as well as an UNK embedding to be used for OOV words. Even with this vocabulary size, querying words from respective UD corpora (train + dev + test) yields high\nOOV rates: in at least half of the 23 languages in our experiments (see Section 5), 29.1% or more of the word types do not appear in the Polyglot vocabulary. The token-level median rate is 9.2%.1\nApplying our MIMICK algorithm to Polyglot embeddings, we obtain a prediction model for each of the 23 languages. Based on preliminary testing on randomly selected held-out development sets of 1% from each Polyglot vocabulary (with error calculated as in Equation 2), we set the following hyper-parameters for the remainder of the experiments: character embedding dimension = 20; one LSTM layer with 50 hidden units; 60 training epochs with no dropout; nonlinearity function g = tanh.2 We initialize character embeddings randomly, and use DyNet to implement the model (Neubig et al., 2017).\nNearest-neighbor examination. As a preliminary sanity check for the validity of our protocol, we examined nearest-neighbor samples in languages for which speakers were available: English, Hebrew, Tamil, and Spanish. Table 1 presents selected English OOV words with\n1Some OOV counts, and resulting model performance, may be adversely affected by tokenization differences between Polyglot and UD. Notably, some languages such as Spanish, Hebrew and Italian exhibit relational synthesis wherein words of separate grammatical phrases are joined into one form (e.g. Spanish del = de + el, \u2018from the-masc.sg.\u2019). For these languages, the UD annotations adhere to the sub-token level, while Polyglot does not perform subtokenization. As this is a real-world difficulty facing users of out-of-the-box embeddings, we do not patch it over in our implementations or evaluation.\n2Other settings, described below, were tuned on the supervised downstream tasks.\ntheir nearest in-vocabulary Polyglot words computed by cosine similarity. These examples demonstrate several properties: (a) word shape is learned well (acronyms, capitalizations, suffixes); (b) the model shows robustness to typos (e.g., developiong, corssing); (c) part-of-speech is learned across multiple suffixes (pesky \u2013 euphoric, ghastly); (d) word compounding is detected (e.g., lawnmower \u2013 bookmaker, postman); (e) semantics are not learned well (as is to be expected from the lack of context in training), but there are surprises (e.g., flatfish \u2013 slimy, watery). Table 2 presents examples from Hebrew that show learned properties can be extended to nominal morphosyntactic attributes (gender, number \u2013 first two examples) and even relational syntactic subword forms such as genetive markers (third example). Names are learned (fourth example) despite the lack of casing in the script. Spanish examples exhibit wordshape and part-of-speech learning patterns with some loose semantics: for example, the plural adjective form prenatales is similar to other familyrelated plural adjectives such as patrimoniales and generacionales. Tamil displays some semantic similarities as well: e.g. enjineer (\u2018engineer\u2019) predicts similarity to other professional terms such as kalviyiyal (\u2018education\u2019), thozhilnutpa (\u2018technical\u2019), and iraanuva (\u2018military\u2019).\nStanford RareWords. The Stanford RareWord evaluation corpus (Luong et al., 2013) focuses on predicting word similarity between pairs involving low-frequency English words, predominantly ones with common morphological affixes. As these words are unlikely to be above the cutoff threshold for standard word embedding models, they emphasize the performance on OOV words.\nFor evaluation of our MIMICK model on the RareWord corpus, we trained the Variational Embeddings algorithm (VarEmbed; Bhatia et al., 2016) on a 20-million-token, 100,000- type Wikipedia corpus, obtaining 128-dimension\nword embeddings for all words in the test corpus. VarEmbed estimates a prior distribution over word embeddings, conditional on the morphological composition. For in-vocabulary words, a posterior is estimated from unlabeled data; for outof-vocabulary words, the expected embedding can be obtained from the prior alone. In addition, we compare to FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016), a high-vocabulary, high-dimensionality embedding benchmark.\nThe results, shown in Table 3, demonstrate that the MIMICK RNN recovers about half of the loss in performance incurred by the original Polyglot training model due to out-of-vocabulary words in the \u201cAll pairs\u201d condition. MIMICK also outperforms VarEmbed. FastText can be considered an upper bound: with a vocabulary that is 25 times larger than the other models, it was missing words from only 44 pairs on this data."}, {"heading": "4 Joint Tagging of Parts-of-Speech and Morphosyntactic Attributes", "text": "The Universal Dependencies (UD) scheme (De Marneffe et al., 2014) features a minimal set of 17 POS tags (Petrov et al., 2012) and supports tagging further language-specific features using attribute-specific inventories. For example, a verb in Turkish could be assigned a value for the evidentiality attribute, one which is absent from Danish. These additional morphosyntactic attributes are marked in the UD dataset as optional per-token attribute-value pairs.\nOur approach for tagging morphosyntactic attributes is similar to the part-of-speech tagging model of Ling et al. (2015), who attach a projection layer to the output of a sentence-level bidirectional LSTM. We extend this approach to morphosyntactic tagging by duplicating this projection layer for each attribute type. The input to our multilayer perceptron (MLP) projection network is the hidden state produced for each token in the sentence by an underlying LSTM, and the output is\nattribute-specific probability distributions over the possible values for each attribute on each token in the sequence. Formally, for a given attribute a with possible values v \u2208 Va, the tagging probability for the i\u2019th word in a sentence is given by:\nPr(awi = v) = (Softmax(\u03c6(hi)))v , (3)\nwith\n(4)\u03c6(hi) = OaW \u00b7 tanh(Wah \u00b7 hi + bah) + baW ,\nwhere hi is the i\u2019th hidden state in the underlying LSTM, and \u03c6(hi) is a two-layer feedforward neural network, with weights Wah and O a W . We apply a softmax transformation to the output; the value at position v is then equal to the probability of attribute v applying to token wi. The input to the underlying LSTM is a sequence of word embeddings, which are initialized to the Polyglot vectors when possible, and to MIMICK vectors when necessary. Alternative initializations are considered in the evaluation, as described in Section 5.2.\nEach tagged attribute sequence (including POS tags) produces a loss equal to the sum of negative log probabilities of the true tags. One way to combine these losses is to simply compute the sum loss. However, many languages have large differences in sparsity across morpho-syntactic attributes, as apparent from Table 4 (rightmost column). We therefore also compute a weighted sum\nloss, in which each attribute is weighted by the proportion of training corpus tokens on which it is assigned a non-NONE value. Preliminary experiments on development set data were inconclusive across languages and training set sizes, and so we kept the simpler sum loss objective for the remainder of our study. In all cases, part-of-speech tagging was less accurate when learned jointly with morphosyntactic attributes. This may be because the attribute loss acts as POS-unrelated \u201cnoise\u201d affecting the common LSTM layer and the word embeddings."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Settings", "text": "The morphological complexity and compositionality of words varies greatly across languages. While a morphologically-rich agglutinative language such as Hungarian contains words that carry many attributes as fully separable morphemes, a sentence in an analytic language such as Vietnamese may have not a single polymorphemic or inflected word in it. To see whether this property is influential on our MIMICK model and its performance in the downstream tagging task, we select languages that comprise a sample of multiple morphological patterns. Language family and script type are other potentially influential factors in an orthography-based approach such as ours, and so we vary along these parameters as well. We also considered language selection recommendations from de Lhoneux and Nivre (2016) and Schluter and Agic\u0301 (2017).\nAs stated above, our approach is built on the Polyglot word embeddings. The intersection of the Polyglot embeddings and the UD dataset (version 1.4) yields 44 languages. Of these, many are under-annotated for morphosyntactic attributes; we select twenty-three sufficiently-tagged languages, with the exception of Indonesian.3 Table 4 presents the selected languages and their typological properties.

We measure partof-speech tagging by overall token-level accuracy.\nFor morphosyntactic attributes, there does not seem to be an agreed-upon metric for reporting performance. Dzeroski et al. (2000) report pertag accuracies on a morphosyntactically tagged corpus of Slovene. Faruqui et al. (2016) report macro-averages of F1 scores of 11 languages from UD 1.1 for the various attributes (e.g., part-ofspeech, case, gender, tense); recall and precision were calculated for the full set of each attribute\u2019s values, pooled together.5 Agic\u0301 et al.

Word embeddings are initialized from Polyglot models, with unseen words assigned the Polyglot-supplied UNK vector.

Word embeddings are initialized from Polyglot, with OOV embeddings inferred from a MIMICK model (Section 3) trained on the Polyglot embeddings.

These improvements are particularly substantial for test-set tokens outside the UD training set, as shown in the right two columns. While test set OOVs are a strength of the CHAR\u2192TAG model (Plank et al., 2016), in many languages there are still considerable improvements to be obtained from the application of MIMICK initialization.

In this paper, we present MIMICK, an approach to generating OOV word embeddings compositionally, by learning a function from spellings to distributional embeddings. Unlike prior work, MIMICK does not require re-training on the original word embedding corpus; instead, learning is performed at the type level. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations demonstrate the power of this simple approach. On 23 languages, MIMICK improves performance over a word-based baseline for tagging part-of-speech and morphosyntactic attributes. It is competitive with (and complementary to) a supervised characterbased model in low-resource settings.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
