These characteristics sometimes make it challenging to interpret obscure lyrics, especially for readers or listeners who are unfamiliar with the genre. To address this problem, several online lyric databases have been created where users can explain, contextualize, or discuss lyrics. Examples include MetroLyrics1 and Genius.com2. We refer to such\n1http://www.metrolyrics.com 2http://genius.com\ncommentary as a lyric annotation (Figure 1). In this work we introduce the task of automated lyric annotation (ALA). Compared to many traditional NLP systems, which are trained on newswire or similar text, an automated system capable of explaining abstract language, or finding alternative text expressions for slang (and other unknown terms) would exhibit a deeper understanding of the nuances of language. As a result, research in this area may open the door to a variety of interesting use cases. In addition to providing lyric annotations, such systems can lead to improved NLP analysis of informal text (blogs, social media, novels and other literary works of fiction), better handling of genres with heavy use of jargon (scientific texts, product manuals), and increased robustness to textual variety in more traditional NLP tasks and genres.\nOur contributions are as follows: 1. To aid in the study of ALA we present a cor-\npus of 803,720 crowdsourced lyric annotation pairs suitable for training models for this task.3 2. We present baseline systems using statistical machine translation (SMT), neural trans-\n3To obtain the data collection please contact the first author of this paper.\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n03 49\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 A\nug 2\n01 7\nlation (Seq2Seq), and information retrieval. 3. We establish an evaluation procedure which\nadopts measures from machine translation, paraphrase generation, and text simplification. Evaluation is conducted using both human and automated means, which we perform and report across all baselines."}, {"heading": "2 The Genius ALA Dataset", "text": "We collect a dataset of crowdsourced annotations, generated by users of the Genius online lyric database. For a given song, users can navigate to a particular stanza or line, view existing annotations for the target lyric, or provide their own annotation. Discussion between users acts to improve annotation quality, as it does with other collaborative online databases like Wikipedia. This process is gamified: users earn IQ points for producing high quality annotations.\nWe collect 736,423 lyrics having a total 1,404,107 lyric annotation pairs from all subsections (rap, poetry, news, etc.) of Genius. We limit the initial release of the annotation data to be English-only, and filter out non-English annotations using a pre-trained language identifier. We also remove annotations which are solely links to external resources, and do not provide useful textual annotations. This reduces the dataset to 803,720 lyric annotation pairs. We list several properties of the collected dataset in Table 1."}, {"heading": "2.1 Context Independent Annotation", "text": "Mining annotations from a collaborative humancurated website presents additional challenges worth noting. For instance, while we are able to generate large quantities of parallel text from Genius, users operate without a single, predefined and shared global goal other than to maximize their own IQ points. As such, there is no motivation to provide annotations for a song in its entirety, or independent of previous annotations.\nFor this reason we distinguish between two types of annotations: context independent (CI) annotations are independent of their surrounding context and can be interpreted without it, e.g., explain specific metaphors or imagery or provide narrative while normalizing slang language. Contrastively, context sensitive (CS) annotations provide broader context beyond the song lyric excerpt, e.g., background information on the artist.\nTo estimate contribution from both types to the dataset, we sample 2,000 lyric annotation pairs and label them as either CI or CS. Based on this sample, an estimated 34.8% of all annotations is independent of context. Table 2 shows examples of both types.\nWhile the goal of ALA is to generate annotations of all types, it is evident from our analysis that CS annotations can not be generated by models trained solely on parallel text. That is, these annotations cannot be generated without background knowledge or added context. Therefore, in this preliminary work we focus on predicting CI lyric annotations."}, {"heading": "3 Baselines", "text": "We experiment with three baseline models used for text simplification and paraphrase generation.\n\u2022 Statistical Machine Translation (SMT): One approach is to treat the task as one of translation, and to use established statistical machine translation (SMT) methods (Quirk et al., 2004) to produce them. We train a standard phrase-based SMT model to translate lyrics to annotations, using GIZA++ (Josef Och and Ney, 2003) for word alignment and Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) for phrasal alignment, training, and decoding.\n\u2022 Seq2Seq: Sequence-to-sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014) offer an alternative to SMT systems, and have been applied successfully to a variety of tasks including machine translation. In Seq2Seq, a recurrent neural network (RNN) encodes the source sequence to a single vector representation. A separate decoder RNN generates the translation conditioned on this representation of the source sequence\u2019s semantics. We utilize Seq2Seq with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014), which allows the model to\nadditionally condition on tokens from the input sequence during decoding.\n\u2022 Retrieval: In practice, similar lyrics may reappear in different contexts with exchangeable annotations. We treat the training corpus as a database of lyrics\u2019 excerpts with corresponding annotations, and at test time select the annotation assigned to the most similar lyric. This baseline is referred to as the retrieval model. We use standard TF-IDF weighted cosine distance as similarity measure between lyrics\u2019 excerpts."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Data", "text": "We evaluate automatic annotators on a selection of 354 CI annotations and partition the rest of the annotations into 2,000 instances for development and the full remainder for training. It is important to note that the annotations used for training and development include CI as well as CS annotations.\nAnnotations often include multiple sentences or even paragraphs for a single lyrics excerpt (which does not include end marks), while machine translation models need aligned corpora at sentence level to perform well (Xu et al., 2016). We therefore transform training data by including each sentence from the annotation as a single training instance with the same lyric, resulting in a total of 1,813,350 sentence pairs.\nWe use this collection of sentence pairs (denoted as sent. in results) to train the SMT model. Seq2Seq models are trained using sentence pairs as well as full annotations. Interestingly, techniques encouraging alignment by matching length and thresholding cosine distance between lyric\nand annotation did not improve performance during development."}, {"heading": "4.2 Measures", "text": "For automated evaluation, we use measures commonly used to evaluate translation systems (BLEU, METEOR), paraphrase generation (iBLEU) and text simplification (SARI).\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) uses a modified form of precision to compare generated annotations against references from Genius. METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011) is based on the harmonic mean of precision and recall and, along with exact word matching, includes stemming and synonymy matching. iBLEU (Sun and Zhou, 2012) is an extension of the BLEU metric to measure diversity as well as adequacy of the annotation, iBLEU = 0.9 \u00d7 BLEU(Annotation, Reference) \u2212 0.1 \u00d7 BLEU(Annotation, Lyric). SARI (Xu et al., 2016) measures precision and recall of words that are added, kept, or deleted separately and averages their arithmetic means.\nWe also measure quality by crowdsourcing ratings via the online platform CrowdFlower.4 We present collaborators with a song lyric excerpt annotated with output from the annotation generators as well as a reference annotation from Genius. Collaborators assign a 5-point rating for Fluency which rates the quality of the generated language, and Information which measures the added clarification by the annotation, a key aspect of this task. For each lyric annotation pair, we gather ratings from three different collaborators and take the average."}, {"heading": "4.3 Hyperparameters and Optimization", "text": "Here we describe implementation and some of the optimizations used when training the models.\n4https://www.crowdflower.com/\nFor Seq2Seq models, we use OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017) and optimize for perplexity on the development set. Vocabulary for both lyrics and annotations is reduced to the 50,000 most frequent tokens and are embedded in a 500-dimensional space.\nWe use two layers of stacked bi-directional LSTMs with hidden states of 1024 dimensions. We regularize using dropout (keep probability of 0.7) and train using stochastic gradient descent with batches of 64 samples for 13 epochs.\nThe decoder of the SMT model is tuned for optimal BLEU scores on the development set using minimum error rate training (Bertoldi et al., 2009)."}, {"heading": "5 Results", "text": "To measure agreement between collaborators, we compute the kappa statistic (Fleiss, 1971). Kappa statistics for fluency and information are 0.05 and 0.07 respectively, which indicates low agreement. The task of evaluating lyric annotations was difficult for CrowdFlower collaborators as was apparent from their evaluation of the task. For evaluation in future work, we recommend recruitment of expert collaborators familiar with the Genius platform and song lyrics.\nTable 3 shows examples of lyrics with annota-\ntions from Genius and those generated by baseline models.\nA notable observation is that translation models learn to take the role of narrator, as is common in CI annotations, and recognize slang language while simplifying it to more standard English.\nAutomatic and human evaluation scores are shown in Table 4. Next to evaluation metrics, we show two properties of automatically generated annotations; the average annotation length relative to the lyric and the occurrence of profanity per token in annotations, using a list of 343 swear words.\nThe SMT model scores high on BLEU, METEOR and SARI but shows a large drop in performance for iBLEU, which penalizes lexical similarity between lyrics and generated annotations as apparent from the amount profanity remaining in the generated annotations.\nStandard SMT rephrases the song lyric from a third person perspective but is conservative in lexical substitutions and keeps close to the grammar of the lyric. A more appropriate objective function for tuning the decoder which promotes lexical dissimilarity as done for paraphrase generation, would be beneficial for this approach.\nSeq2Seq models generate annotations more dissimilar to the song lyric and obtain higher iBLEU\nand Information scores. To visualize some of the alignments learned by the translation models, Fig. 2 shows word-by-word attention scores for a translation by the Seq2Seq model.\nWhile the retrieval model obtains quality annotations when test lyrics are highly similar to lyrics from the training set, retrieved annotations are often unrelated to the test lyric or specific to the song lyric it is retrieved from.\nOut of the unsupervised metrics, METEOR obtained the highest Pearson correlation (Pearson, 1895) with human ratings for Information with a coefficient of 0.15."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "Work on modeling of social annotations has mainly focused on the use of topic models (Iwata et al., 2009; Das et al., 2014) in which annotations are assumed to originate from topics. They can be used as a preprocessing step in machine learning tasks such as text classification and image recognition but do not generate language as required in our ALA task.\nText simplification and paraphrase generation have been widely studied. Recent work has highlighted the need for large text collections (Xu et al., 2015) as well as more appropriate evaluation measures (Xu et al., 2016; Galley et al., 2015). They indicated that especially informal language,\nwith its high degree of lexical variation, e.g., as used in social media or lyrics, poses serious challenges (Xu et al., 2013).\nText generation for artistic purposes, such as poetry and lyrics, has been explored most commonly using templates and constraints (Barbieri et al., 2012). In regard to rap lyrics, Wu et al. (2013) present a system for rap lyric generation that produces a single line of lyrics that is meant to be a response to a single line of input. Most recent work is that of Zhang et al. (2014) and Potash et al. (2015), who show the effectiveness of RNNs for the generation of poetry and lyrics.\nThe task of annotating song lyrics is also related to metaphor processing. As annotators often explain metaphors used in song lyrics, the Genius dataset can serve as a resource to study computational modeling of metaphors (Shutova and Teufel, 2010)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We presented and released the Genius dataset to study the task of Automated Lyric Annotation. As a first investigation, we studied automatic generation of context independent annotations as machine translation and information retrieval. Our baseline system tests indicate that our corpus is suitable to train machine translation systems.\nStandard SMT models are capable of rephrasing and simplifying song lyrics but tend to keep close to the structure of the song lyric. Seq2Seq models demonstrated potential to generate more fluent and informative text, dissimilar to the lyric.\nA large fraction of the annotations is heavily based on context and background knowledge (CS), one of their most appealing aspects. As future work we suggest injection of structured and unstructured external knowledge (Ahn et al., 2016) and explicit modeling of references (Yang et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

To stimulate research on this task, we release a large collection of crowdsourced annotations for song lyrics. We analyze the performance of translation and retrieval models on this task, measuring performance with both automated and human evaluation. We find that each model captures a unique type of information important to the task.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
