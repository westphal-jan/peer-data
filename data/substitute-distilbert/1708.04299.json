A wide variety of researches have been conducted in detecting emotions from facial expressions and audio waves (Yu et al., 2001; Zeng et al., 2006; Lucey et al., 2010). The recent advent of natural language processing and machine learning has made the task of emotion detection on text possible, yet since emotions are not necessarily conveyed on text, quantifying different types of emotions using only text is generally challenging.\nAnother challenging aspect about this task is due to the lack of annotated datasets. There are few publicly available datasets (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007; Alm, 2008; Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez,\n2017; Buechel and Hahn, 2017). However, in order to further explore the feasibility of text-based emotion detection on dialogue, a more comprehensive dataset would be desired. This paper presents a new corpus that comprises transcripts of the TV show, Friends, where each utterance is annotated with one of the seven emotions: sad, mad, scared, powerful, peaceful, joyful, and neutral. Several annotation tasks are conducted through crowdsourcing for the maintenance of a high quality dataset. Dialogues from these transcripts include disfluency, slangs, metaphors, humors, etc., which make this task even more challenging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest text-based corpus providing finegrained emotions for such long sequences of consecutive utterances in multiparty dialogue.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) have been popular for several tasks on document classification. One of the major advantages of CNN is found in its capability of extensive feature extraction through deep-layered convolutions. Nonetheless, CNN are often not used for sequence modeling (Waibel et al., 1989; LeCun et al., 1995; Gehring et al., 2017) because their basic architecture does not take previous sequence information into account. One common approach to alleviate this issue is using recurrent neural networks (Sutskever et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016). However, RNNs typically perform slower and require more training data to avoid overfitting. To exploit the sequence information embedded in our corpus yet to employ the advantages of CNN, sequenced-based CNN (SCNN) are proposed along with attention mechanisms, which guide CNN to fuse features form the current state with features from the previous states. The contributions of this research are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We create a new corpus providing fine-grained emotion annotation on dialogue and give thorough corpus analytics (Section 3) .\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n04 29\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n4 A\nug 2\n01 7\n\u2022 We introduce several sequence-based convolution neural network models with attention to facilitate sequential dependencies among utterances. (Section 4).\n\u2022 We give both quantitative and qualitative analysis that show the advantages of SCNN over the basic CNN as well as the advances in the attention mechanisms (Section 5)."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Text-based Emotion Detection", "text": "Text-based emotion detection is on its early stage in natural language processing although it has recently drawn lots of attention. There are three common methods researchers have employed for detecting emotions from text: keyword-based, learningbased and hybrids of those two. In the first method, classification is done by aid of emotional keywords. Strapparava et al. (2004) categorized emotions by mapping keywords in sentences into lexical representation of affective concepts. Chaumartin (2007) did emotion detection on news headlines. The performance of these keyword-based approaches had been rather unsatisfactory due to the fact that the semantics of the keywords heavily depend on the contexts, and it is significantly affected by the absence of those keywords (Shaheen et al., 2014)\nTwo types of machine learning approaches have been used for the second method, supervised approaches where training examples are used to classify documents into emotional categories, and unsupervised approaches where statistical measures are used to capture the semantic dependencies between words and infer their relevant emotional categories. Chaffar and Inkpen (2011) detected emotions from several corpora collected from blog, news headline, and fairy tale using a supervised approach. Douiji et al. (2016) used YouTube comments and developed an unsupervised learning algorithm to detect emotions from the comments. Their approach gave\ncomparative performance to supervised approaches such as Chaffar and Inkpen (2011) that support vector machines were employed for statistical learning.\nThe hybrid method attempts to take advantages from both the keyword-based and learning methods. Seol et al. (2008) used an ensemble of a keywordbased approach and knowledge-based artificial neural networks to classify emotions in drama, novel, and public web diary. Hybrid approaches generally perform well although their architectures tend to be complicated for the replication."}, {"heading": "2.2 Sequence Modeling on Dialogue", "text": "The tasks of state tracking and dialogue act classification are ongoing fields of research similar to our task. Shi et al. (2016) proposed multi-channel CNN for cross-language dialogue tracking. Dufour et al.

For this research, we take transcripts from the first four seasons and create a corpus by adding another layer of annotation with emotions. As a result, our corpus comprises 97 episodes, 897 scenes, and 12,606 utterances, where each utterance is annotated with one of the seven emotions borrowed from the six primary emotions in the Willcox (1982)\u2019s feeling wheel, sad, mad, scared, powerful, peaceful, joyful, and a default emotion of neutral.

(2008), crowdsourcing has been widely used for the creation of many corpora in natural language processing. Our annotation tasks are conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each MTurk HIT shows a scene, where each utterance in the scene is annotated by four crowd workers who are asked to choose the most relevant emotion associated with that utterance. To assign a suitable budget for each HIT, the corpus is divided into four batches, where all scenes in each batch are restricted to the [5, 10), [11, 15), [15, 20), [20, 25] number of utterances and are budgeted to 10, 13, 17, 20 cents per HIT, respectively.

First, Cohen\u2019s kappa is used to measure the agreement between two annotators whereas Fleiss\u2019 kappa is used for three and four annotators. Second, the partial agreement (an agreement between any pair of annotators) is measured to illustrate the improvement\n1nlp.mathcs.emory.edu/character-mining\nfrom a fewer to a greater number of crowd workers. Among all kinds of annotator groups, the kappa scores around 14% are achieved. Such low scores are rather expected because emotion detection is highly subjective so that annotators often judge different emotions that are all acceptable for the same utterance. This may also be attributed to the limitation of our dataset; a higher kappa score could be achieved if the annotators were provided with a multimodal dataset (e.g., text, speech, image).\nWhile the kappa scores are not so much compelling, the partial agreement scores show more promising results. The impact of a greater number of annotators is clearly illustrated in this measurement; over 70% of the annotation have no agreement with only two annotators, whereas 85% of the annotation find some agreement with four annotators. This implies that it is possible to improve the annotation quality by adding more annotators.\nIt is worth mentioning that crowd workers were asked to choose from 37 emotions for the first 25% of the annotation, which comprised 36 secondary emotions from Willcox (1982) and the neutral emotion. However, vast disagreements were observed for this annotation, resulting Cohen\u2019s kappa score of 0.8%. Thus, we proceeded with the seven emotions described above, hoping to go back and complete the annotation for fine-grained emotions later."}, {"heading": "3.3 Voting and Ranking", "text": "We propose a voting/ranking scheme that allows to assign appropriate labels to the utterances with disagreed annotation. Given the quadruple annotation, we first divide the dataset into five-folds (Table 4):\nFor the first three folds, the annotation coming from the majority vote is considered the gold label (a1).\nThe least absolute error (LAE) is then measured for each annotator by comparing one\u2019s annotation to the gold labels. For the last two folds, annotation generated by the annotator with the minimum LAE is chosen as gold, which is reasonable since those annotators generally produce higher quality annotation. With this scheme, 75.5% of the dataset can be deterministically assigned with gold labels from voting and the rest can be assigned by ranking."}, {"heading": "3.4 Analysis", "text": "Table 5 shows the distribution of all emotions in our corpus. The two most dominant emotions, neutral and joyful, together yield over 50% of the dataset, which does not seem to be balanced although it is understandable given the nature of this show, that is a comedy. However, when the coarse-grained emotions are considered, positive, negative, and neutral, they yield about 40%, 30%, and 30% respectively, which gives a more balanced distribution. The last column shows the ratio of annotation that all four annotators agree. Only around 1% of the annotation shows complete agreement for peaceful and powerful, which is reasonable since these emotions often get confused with neutral."}, {"heading": "3 Emotions 7 Emotions Ratio 4-Agree", "text": "Figure 1 illustrates how emotions of the six main characters are progressing and getting affected by\nother utterances as time elapses within a scene.

Rows correspond to the labels obtained using the voting scheme (Section 3.3), and columns represent the emotions selected by each of four annotators.

Each row in x represents a token in the utterance. At each time step, region sizes of \u03c1 \u2208 {1, 2, 3, ..., r}, r \u2208 N are considered. Each region has the f -number of filters. As a result of applying convolution and max-pooling, a univariate feature vector ~h \u2208 Rr\u00b7f is generated for the current utterance.\nIn the next step, the dense feature vectors from the current utterance and k-1 previous utterances within the same dialogue get concatenated columnwise. As a result of this concatenation, the vector ~l \u2208 Rr\u00b7f \u00b7k is created. Then, 1-D convolution is applied to ~l to obtain the vector ~q \u2208 R(r\u00b7f \u00b7k\u2212F )/S+1, where S is the stride and F is the receptive field of the 1-D convolution. As a result of this operation, features extracted from the current utterance gets fused with the features associated with the previous utterances. In the final step, softmax is applied for the classification of seven emotions."}, {"heading": "4.2 Sequence Unification: Convolution", "text": "Let us refer the model in Section 4.1 to SCNNc.

This mechanism allows the SCNN models to learn what part of the features should be attended more. Essentially, this attention model is a weighted arithmetic sum of current utterance\u2019s feature vector where the weights are chosen based on the relevance of each element of that feature vector given the unified feature vectors from the previous utterances.\nFigure 5 depicts attention on SCNNc, SCNNac . In this model, the current feature vector ~h and the k-1 previous feature vectors get concatenated rowwise to create Z \u2208 Rk\u00d7r\u00b7f . An attention matrix A \u2208 Rr\u00b7f\u00d7k is applied to the current feature vector. The weights of this attention matrix are learned given the past feature vectors.

(2015) to fuse time-series information for visual recognition and description.

First column of the table indicates the number of previous utterances included in our model. We report both accuracy and F1score for evaluating the performance of our models. F1-score, by considering false positives and false negatives is generally a better way of measuring the performance on a corpus with unbalanced distributed classes. In SCNNc and SCNNac , by including previous three utterances, and in SCNNv and SCNNav , by considering previous five utterances the best results are achieved. We also ran our experiments with considering more than five utterances, however no significant improvement was observed.\nTable 8 summarizes the overall performance of our models on the evaluation set. To compare our proposed models to some other baseline models, we also include performances of CNN and RNN-CNN. The accuracies and the F1-scores are reported for the cases of 7 and 3 emotions (Table 5),\nwhere the latter case is comparable to the typical sentiment analysis task. For the models listed in table 8, we choose the sequence numbers that had the best performances on the development set (3 for SCNNc and SCNNac , 5 for SCNNv and SCNN a v). From tables 7 and 8, we can see that SCNNac outperformed all other listed models.\nTo fuse the generated dense feature vectors we applied different combinations of regularized feature fusion networks similar to the networks employed in Wu et al. (2015) and Bodla et al. (2017). However, for our task, none of these fusion networks performed better than the 1-D convolutional layer we utilized. It worth to be mention that, in the first time step of our both attentive models, the two inputs to the attention matrix/vector are two identical vectors (first utterance\u2019s feature vector) which mean that the main impact of attention mechanism starts from the second time step."}, {"heading": "5.5 Analysis", "text": "Figure 7 shows the confusion matrix of gold labels and prediction for our best model, SCNNac . Mostly all of the emotions get confused the most with neutral. Peaceful has the highest rate of confusion with neutral; 30% of total number of examples in this class are confused with neutral. Whereas, joyful and powerful have the least confusion rates with neutral (13.8% and 20.4% respectively).\nTo further explore the effect of sequence number, we divided the evaluation set into four batches based on the number of utterances in the scenes as described in section 3.1. After examining the performances of SCNNc and SCNNac on four batches, we noticed these two models by considering previous three sequences, performed better (roughly 4% boost in F1-scores) on the first two batches (i.e. scenes containing [5,15) utterances) compared to other models such as base CNN. It seems, in very long scenes which usually contain more speakers and transitions between the speakers, our proposed models did not significantly outperform base CNN.\nDuring our experiments we observed that RNNCNN did not have a compelling performance. Generally, complicated models with higher number of hyper parameters require a larger corpus for tuning the hyper parameters. Given the relatively small size of our proposed corpus for such a model, we noticed that RNN-CNN over fitted rapidly at the very early epochs. It was basically well-tuned to detect two most dominate classes. Also, SCNNv, did not outperform base CNN model although it did outperform base CNN after including attention mechanism (SCNNav). We believe that size of our corpus could be inadequate to train this model which has more hyper-parameters than SCNNc.\nFigure 8 depicts the heat-map representation of the vector created from multiplication of current utterance\u2019s feature vector with the attention matrix A, in SCNNac . The heat-map includes the first eight consecutive utterances (rows of the heat-map) of\na scene. Each row shows importance of the current utterance (color-mapped with blue) as well as previous three utterances (last three columns of the heat-map) at that particular time step. At each time step, the current utterance has the largest value which means our model attends more to the current utterance compared to previous ones. Attention matrix learns to assign the weights to previous utterances given the weight assigned to the current utterance.\nFor instance, utterance number 7 and 8 attend more to their previous two utterances (which have similar emotions). Utterance number 5 attends less to utterance 2 as the second utterance has a positive emotion. Similarly, utterance 2 attends more to its previous utterance as they both have a positive emotion. Generally, in the cases where the emotion of current utterance is neutral, the weights assigned to its previous utterances are relatively small and mostly similar."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this work, we introduced a new corpus for emotion detection task which was gathered from the spoken dialogues. We also proposed attentive SCNN models which incorporated the existing sequence information. The experimental results showed that our proposed models outperformed the base CNN.

We first present a new corpus that provides annotation of seven emotions on consecutive utterances in dialogues extracted from the show, Friends. We then suggest four types of sequence-based convolutional neural network models with attention that leverage the sequence information encapsulated in dialogue.
