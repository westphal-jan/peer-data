Introduction and related works", "text": "Zero-Shot Classification (ZSC) [22] addresses classification problems where not all the classes are represented in the training examples. ZSC can be made possible by defining a high-level description of the categories, relating the new classes (the unseen classes) to classes for which training examples are available (seen classes). Learning is usually done by leveraging an intermediate level of representation, the attributes, that provide semantic information about the categories to classify. As pointed out by [32] this paradigm can be compared to how human can identify a new object from a description of it, leveraging similarities between its description and previously learned concepts.\nRecent ZSC algorithms (e.g. [1, 5]) do the classification by defining a zero-shot prediction function that outputs the class y having the maximum compatibility score with\nthe image x: f(x) = argmaxy S(x, y). The compatibility function, for its part, is often defined as S(x, y;W ) = \u03b8(x)tW\u03c6(y) where \u03b8 and \u03c6 are two projections and W is a bilinear function relating the two in a common embedding. There are different variants in the recent literature on how the projections or the similarity measure are computed [11, 8, 15, 29, 32, 40, 41, 43], but in all cases the class is chosen as the one maximizing the compatibility score. This embedding and maximal compatibility approach, however, does not exploit, in the learning phase, the information potentially contained in the semantic representation of the unseen categories. The only step where a discriminating capability is exploited is in the final label selection which uses an argmaxy decision scheme, but not in the setting of the compatibility score itself.\nA parallel can be easily done between the aforementioned approaches and generative models such as defined\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n06 97\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n3 A\nug 2\nin the machine learning community. Generative models estimate the joint distribution p(y, x) of images and classes, often by learning the class prior probability p(y) and the class-conditional density p(x|y) separately. However, as it has been observed for a long time [37], discriminative approaches trained for predicting directly the class label have better performance than model-based approaches as long as the learning database reliably samples the target distribution.\nDespite one can expect discriminative methods to give better performance [37], they can\u2019t be used directly in the case of ZSC for obvious reasons: as no images are available for some categories, discriminative classifiers cannot be learned out-of-the-box.\nThis paper proposes to overcome this difficulty by generating training features for the unseen classes, in such a way that standard discriminative classifiers can be learned (Fig. 1). Generating data for machine learning tasks has been studied in the literature e.g., [18] or [3] to compensate for imbalanced training sets. Generating novel training examples from the existing ones is also at the heart of the technique called Data Augmentation, frequently used for training deep neural networks [23]. When there is no training data at all for some categories, some underlying parametric representation can be used to generate missing training data, assuming a mapping from the underlying representation to the image space. [12] generated images by applying warping and other geometric / photometric transformations to prototypical logo exemplars. A similar idea was also presented in [19] for text spotting in images. [7] capture what they call The Gist of a Gesture by recording human gestures, representing them by a model and use this model to generate a large set of realistic gestures.\nWe build in this direction, in the context of ZSC, the underlying representation being some attribute or text based description of the unseen categories, and the transformation from attributes to image features being learned from the examples of the seen classes. A relevant way to learn this transformation is to use generative models such as denoising auto encoders [4] and generative adversarial nets (GAN) [16] or their variants [10, 26]. GANs consist in estimating generative models via an adversarial process simultaneously learning two models, a generative model that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than the generator. The Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets of [28] is a very relevant variant adapted to our problem.\nIn addition to the advantage of using discriminative classifiers \u2013 which is expected to give better performance \u2013 our approach, by nature, can address the more realistic task of Generalized Zero-Shot Classification (GZSC). This problem, introduced in [9], assumes that both seen and unseen\ncategories are present at test time, making the traditional approaches suffering from bias decision issues. In contrast, the proposed approach uses (artificial) training examples of both seen and unseen classes during training, avoiding the aforementioned issues.\nAnother reason to perform classification inference directly in the visual feature space rather than in an abstract attribute or embedding space is that data are usually more easily separated in the former, especially when using discriminant deep features that are now commonly available.\nThis paper experimentally validates the proposed strategy on 4 standard Zero-Shot classification datasets (Animals with Attributes (AWA) [22], SUN attributes (SUN) [31], Apascal&Ayahoo (aP&Y) [14] and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB) [38]), and gives insight on how the approach scales on large datasets such as ImageNet [11]. It shows state-of-the-art performance on all datasets for both ZSC and GZSC."}, {"heading": "2. Approach", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1. Zero shot classification", "text": "As motivated in the introduction, we address in this paper the problem of learning a classifier capable of discriminating between a given set of classes where empirical data is only available for a subset of it, the so-called seen classes. In the vocabulary of zero-shot classification, the problem is usually qualified as inductive \u2014 we do not have access to any data from the unseen classes \u2014 as opposed to transductive where the unseen data is available but not the associated labels. We do not address in this paper the transductive setting, considering that the availability of target data is a big constraint in practice.\nThe learning dataset Ds is defined by a series of triplets {xsi , asi , ysi } Ns i=1 where x s i \u2208 X is the raw data (image or features), ysi \u2208 Ys is the associated class label and asi is a rich semantic representation of the class (attributes, word vector or text) belonging to As. This semantic representation is expected to i) contain enough information to discriminate between classes by itself, ii) be predictable from raw data and iii) infer unambiguously the class label y = l(a).\nIn an inductive ZSC problem, all that is known regarding the new target domain is the set of semantic class representations Au of the unseen classes. The goal is to use this information and the structure of the semantic representation space to design a classification function f able to predict the class label y\u0302 = f(x;Au,Ds). The classification function f is usually parametric and settled by the optimization of an empirical learning criterion."}, {"heading": "2.2. Discriminative approach for ZSC", "text": "In ZSC, the main problem is precisely the fact that no data is available for the unseen classes. The approach taken\nin this paper is to artificially generate data for the unseen classes given that seen classes and their semantic representations provide enough information to do so, and then apply a discriminative approach to learn the class predictor.\nThe availability of data for the unseen classes has two main advantages: it can make the classification of seen and unseen classes as a single homogeneous process, allowing to address Generalized Zero Shot Classification as a single supervised classification problem; it potentially allows a larger number of unseen classes, which is for instance required for datasets such ImageNet [11].\nLet D\u0302u = {x\u0302ui , aui , yui } Nu i=1 be a database generated to account for the unseen semantic class representation au \u2208 Au. The ZSC classification function becomes: y\u0302 = fD(x; D\u0302u,Ds) and can be used in association with the seen data Ds, to learn a homogeneous supervised problem."}, {"heading": "2.3. Generating unseen data", "text": "Our generators of unseen data build on the recently proposed approaches for conditional data generation as presented in section 1. The idea is to learn globally a parametric random generative process G using a differentiable criterion able to compare, as a whole, a target data distribution and a generated one.\nGiven z a random sample from a fixed multivariate prior distribution, typically uniform or Gaussian, and w the set of parameters, new sample data consistent with the semantic description a are generated by applying the function: x\u0302 = G(a, z;w). A simple way to generate conditional x\u0302 data is to concatenate the semantic representation a and the random prior z as the input of a multi-layer network, as shown in Fig. 2.\nWe now present 4 different strategies to design such a conditional data generator, the functional structure of the generator being common to all the described approaches.\nGenerative Moment Matching Network A first approach is to adapt the Generative Moment Matching Network (GMMN) proposed in [24] to conditioning. The generative process will be considered as good if for each semantic description a two random populations X (a) from Ds and X\u0302 (a;w) sampled from the generator have low maximum mean discrepancy which is a probability divergence measure between two distributions. This divergence can be approximated using a Hilbert kernel based statistics [17] \u2013 typically a linear combination of Gaussian functions with various widths \u2014 which has the big advantage of being differentiable and may be thus exploited as a machine learning cost. Network parameters w are then obtained by optimizing the differentiable statistics by stochastic gradient descent, using batches of generated and real data conditioned by the semantic description a.\nConditional Generative adversarial models Our second model builds on the principles of the generative adversarial networks (GAN), which is to learn a discrepancy measure between a true and a generated distributions \u2014 the Discriminator \u2014 simultaneously with the data generator. One extension allowing to produce conditional distributions is the AC-GAN [30] (Fig. 2) where the generated and the true distributions are compared using a binary classifier, and the quality of the conditional generation is controlled by the performance of this auxiliary task.\nThis model bears similarities with the GMMN model, the key difference being that in the GMMN distributions of true and generated data are compared using the kernel based empirical statistics while in the AC-GAN case it is measured by a learned discriminative parametric model.\nDenoising Auto-Encoder Our third generator relies on the work presented in [4], where an encoder/decoder structure is proposed to design a data generator, the latent code playing the role of the random prior z used to generate the data. A simple extension able to introduce a conditional data generation control has been developed by concatenating the semantic representation a to the code that is fed to the decoder (Fig. 2).\nIn practice, this model is learned as a standard autoencoder, except that i) some noise is added to the input and ii) the semantic representation a is concatenated to the code in the hidden layer. For generating novel examples, only the decoder part, i.e. the head of the network using z and a as input to produce x\u0302 is used.\nAdversarial Auto-Encoder Our fourth generator is inspired by [26], which is an extension of the denoising auto-\nencoder. It introduces an adversarial criterion to control the latent code produced by the encoder part, so that the code distribution matches a fixed prior distribution. This extra constraint is expected to ensure that all parts of the sampling prior space will produce meaningful data.\nDuring training, both the auto-encoder and the discriminator are learned simultaneously. For generating novel examples, as for the denoising auto-encoder, only the decoder part is used."}, {"heading": "2.4. Implementing the generators", "text": "We implemented our 4 generative models with neural networks, whose architectures are illustrated Fig. 2. Hidden layers are fully connected (FC) with leaky-relu nonlinearity [25] (leakage coefficient of 0.2). For the models using a classifier (the AC-GAN and the Adversarial autoencoder), the classifier is a linear classifier (fully connected layer + Softmax activation function). The loss used to measure the quality of the reconstruction in the two autoencoders is the L2 norm.\nRegarding how to sample the noise z, we did not observe any difference between sampling it from a Gaussian distribution or from a uniform distribution."}, {"heading": "3. Experiments", "text": "In this section, after presenting the datasets and the experimental settings, we start by comparing the different generative models described in the previous section. We then show how our approach can be used for the Generalized Zero-shot Classification Task, which is one of the key contributions of the paper, provide some experiments on a large scale zero shot classification task, and finally compare our approach with state-of-the art Zero-Shot approaches on the regular Zero-shot Classification Task."}, {"heading": "3.1. Datasets and Settings", "text": "A first experimental evaluation is done on 4 standard ZSC datasets: Animals with Attributes (AWA) [22], SUN attributes (SUN) [31], Apascal&Ayahoo (aP&Y) [14] and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB) [38] . These benchmarks exhibit a great diversity of concepts; SUN and CUB are for fine-Grained categorization, and include respectively birds and scenes images; AwA contains images of animals from 50 different categories; finally, aP&Y has broader concepts, from cars to animals. For each dataset, attributes descriptions are given, either at the class level or at image level. aP&Y, CUB and SUN have per image binary attributes that we average to produce per class real valued representations. In order to make comparisons with other works, we follow the same training/testing splits for AwA [22], CUB [2] and aP&Y [14]. For SUN we experiment two different settings: one with 10 unseen classes as in [20], a\nsecond, more competitive, with ten different folds randomly chosen and averaged, as proposed by [8] (72/71 splits).\nImage features are computed using two deep networks, the VGG-VeryDeep-19 [34] and the GoogLeNet [36] networks. For the VGG-19 we use the 4,096-dim top-layer hidden unit activations (fc7) while for the GoogLeNet we use the 1,024-dim top-layer pooling units. We keep the weights learned on ImageNet fixed i.e., we don\u2019t apply any fine-tuning.\nThe classifiers are obtained by adding a standard Fully Connected with Softmax layer to the pre-trained networks. We purposively chose a simple classifier to better observe the behavior of the generators. In all our experiments we generated 500 artificial image features by class, which we consider to be a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and training time; we have not observed any significant improvement when adding more images.\nEach architecture has its own set of hyper-parameters (typically the number of units per layer, the number of hidden layers, the learning rate, etc.). They are obtained trough a \u2019Zero-shot\u2019 cross-validation procedure. In this procedure, 20% of the seen classes are considered as unseen (hence used as validation set), allowing to choose the hyperparameters maximizing the accuracy on this so-obtained validation set. In practice, typical values for the number of neurons (resp. the number of hidden layers) are in the range of [500-2000] (resp. 1 or 2).\nModel parameters are initialized according to a centered Gaussian distribution (\u03c3 = 0.02). They are optimized with the Adam solver [21] with a cross-validated learning rate (typically of 10\u22124), using mini-batches of size 128 except for the GMMN where each batch contains all the training images of one class, to make the estimation of the statistics more reliable. In order to avoid over-fitting, we used dropout [35] at every layer (probability of drop of 0.2 for the inputs layers and of 0.5 for the hidden layers). Input data (both image features and w2c vectors) are scaled to [0,1] by applying an affine transformation. With the TensorFlow framework [13] running on a Nvidia Titan X pascal GPU, the learning stage takes around 10 minutes for a given set of hyper-parameters. Our code will be made publicly available."}, {"heading": "3.2. Comparing the different generative models", "text": "Our first round of experiments consists in comparing the performance of the 4 generative models described in Section 2.3, on the regular Zero-shot classification task. Our intention is to select the best one for further experiments. Performance on the validation set is reported Table 1. We can see that the GMMN model outperforms the 3 others on average, with a noticeable 5% improvement on aP&Y. Its optimization is also computationally more stable than the adversarial versions. We consequently chose this generator for the following.\nWe explain the superiority of the GMMN model by the fact it aligns the distributions by using an explicit model of the divergence of the distributions while the adversarial autoencoder and the AC-GAN have to learn it. For its part, the denoising autoencoder doesn\u2019t have any guaranty that the distributions are aligned, explaining its weak performance compared to the 3 other generators."}, {"heading": "3.3. Generalized Zero-Shot Classification task", "text": "In this section, we follow the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSC) protocol introduced by Chao et al. [9]. In this protocol, test data are from any classes, seen or unseen. This task is more realistic and harder, as the number of class candidates is larger.\nWe follow the notations of [9], i.e. u \u2192 u: test images from unseen classes, labels of unseen classes (conventional ZSC)\ns\u2192 s: test images from seen classes, labels of seen classes (multi-class classication for seen classes) u\u2192 a: test images from unseen classes, labels of seen and unseen classes (GZSC) s \u2192 a: test images from seen classes, labels of seen and unseen classes (GZSC)\nIn the first two cases, only the seen/unseen classes are used in the training phase. In the last two cases, the classifier is learned with training data combining images generated for all classes (seen and not seen).\nMost of the recent ZSC works e.g., [2, 6, 5, 32] are focused on improving the embedding or the scoring function. However, [9] has shown that this type of approach is unpractical with GZSC. Indeed the scoring function is in this case biased toward seen classes, leading to very low accuracy on the unseen classes. This can be seen on Table 2 and 3 (u \u2192 a column), where the accuracy drops significantly compared to regular ZSC performance. The data distribution of the ZSC datasets are strongly subject to this bias, as unseen classes are very similar to seen classes both in terms of visual appearance and attribute description. When seen and unseen classes are candidates, it becomes much harder to distinguish between them. For example, the horse (seen) and the zebra classes (unseen) of the AwA dataset cannot be distinguished by standard ZSC methods.\nAs we can see on Table 2 and 3, our generative approach outperforms any other previous approach. In the hardest case, u \u2192 a, it gives the accuracy of 30% (resp. 10%) higher than state-of-the-art approaches on the AwA (resp. CUB) dataset. It can be easily explained by the fact that it doesn\u2019t suffer from the scoring function problem we mentioned, as the Softmax classifier is learned to discriminate both seen and unseen classes, offering a decisive solution to the bias problem."}, {"heading": "3.4. Large Scale Zero-Shot Classification", "text": "We compared our approach with state-of-the-art methods on a large-scale Zero-Shot classification task. These experiences mirror those presented in [15]: 1000 classes from those of the ImageNet 2012 1K set [33] are chosen for training (seen classes) while 20.345 others are considered to be unseen classes with no image available. Image features are computed with the GoogLeNet network [36].\nIn contrast with ZSC datasets, no attributes are provided for defining unseen classes. We represent those categories using a skip-gram language model [27]. This model is learned on a dump of the Wikipedia corpus (\u22483 billion words). Skip-gram is a language model learned to predict context from words. The neural network has 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer having the size of the vocabulary (same size as the input layer). The hidden layer has 500 neurons in our implementation. In the literature, the hidden layer has been reported to be an in-\nteresting embedding space for representing word. Consequently, We use this hidden layer to describe each class label by embedding the class name into this 500-dimensional space. Some classes cannot be represented as their name is not contained in the vocabulary established by parsing the Wikipedia corpus. Such classes are ignored, bringing the number of classes from 20,842 to 20,345 classes. For fair comparison, we take the same language model as [8] with the same classes excluded.\nAs in [8, 15] our model is evaluated on three different scenarios, with an increasing number of unseen classes: i) 2-hop: 1,509 classes ii) 3-hop: 7,678 classes, iii) All: all unseen categories.\nFor this task we use the Flat-Hit@K metric, the percentage of test images for which the model returns the true labels in the top K prediction scores.\nTable 4 summarizes the performance on the 3 hops. As one can see, our model gets state-of the art performance for each configuration. As it can be observed from these experiments, our generative model is very suitable for this large scale GZSC problem e.g., our approach improves by 5% best competitors for the Flat-Hit 1 metric on the 2-hop scenario."}, {"heading": "3.5. Classical Zero-Shot Classification task", "text": "In this last section, we follow the protocol of the standard ZSC task: during training, only data from seen classes are available while at test time new images (from unseen classes only) have to be assigned to one of the unseen classes.\nAs explained in the introduction, the recent ZSC literature [2, 6, 5, 32] mostly focuses on developing a good em-\nbedding for comparing attributes and images. One of our motivations for generating training images was to make the training of discriminative classifiers possible, assuming it would result in better performance. This section aims at validating this hypothesis on the regular ZSC task.\nTable 5 summarizes our experiments, reporting the accuracy obtained by state of the art methods on the 4 ZSC datasets, with 2 different deep image features. Each entry is the mean/standard deviation computed on 5 different runs.\nWith the VGG network, our method give above state-ofthe-art performance on each dataset, with a noticeable improvement of more than 15% on CUB. On the SUN dataset, Changpinyo et al. [8]\u2019s seems to give better performance but used the MIT Places dataset to learn the features. It has been recently pointed out in sec. 5.1 of Xiang et al. [42] that this database \u201dintersects with both training and test classes of SUN, which could explain their better results compared to ours."}, {"heading": "4.

"This paper addresses the task of learning an image classifier when some categories are defined by semantic descriptions only (e.g. visual attributes) while the others are defined by exemplar images as well. This task is often referred to as the Zero-Shot classification task (ZSC). Most of the previous methods rely on learning a common embedding space allowing to compare visual features of unknown categories with semantic descriptions. This paper argues that these approaches are limited as i) efficient discriminative classifiers can\u2019t be used ii) classification tasks with seen and unseen categories (Generalized Zero-Shot Classification or GZSC) can\u2019t be addressed efficiently. In contrast, this paper suggests to address ZSC and GZSC by i) learning a conditional generator using seen classes ii) generate artificial training examples for the categories without exemplars. ZSC is then turned into a standard supervised learning problem. Experiments with 4 generative models and 5 datasets experimentally validate the approach, giving state-of-the-art results on both ZSC and GZSC.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
