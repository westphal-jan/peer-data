Cluster analysis of gene expression data has proved to be a useful tool for identifying co-expressed genes. DNA microarrays are emerged as the leading technology to measure gene expression levels primarily, because of their high throughput. Results from these experiments are usually presented in the form of a data matrix in which rows represent genes and columns represent conditions [12]. Each entry in the matrix is a measure of the expression level of a particular gene under a specific condition. Analysis of these data sets reveals genes of\nunknown functions and the discovery of functional relationships between genes [18]. The most popular clustering algorithms in microarray gene expression analysis are Hierarchical clustering [11], K-Means clustering [3], and SOM [8]. Of these K-Means clustering is very simple and fast efficient. This is most popular one and it is developed by Mac Queen [6]. The easiness of KMeans clustering algorithm made this algorithm used in several fields. The K-Means algorithm is effective in producing clusters for many practical applications, but the computational complexity of the original K-Means algorithm is very high, especially for large data sets. The K-Means clustering algorithm is a partitioning clustering method that separates the data into K groups. One drawback in the K-Means algorithm is that of a priori fixation of number of clusters [2, 3, 4, 17].\nIterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA) tries to find the best cluster centres through iterative approach, until some convergence criteria are met. One significant feature of ISODATA over K-Means is that the initial number of clusters may be merged or split, and so the final number of clusters may be different from the number of clusters specified as part of the input. The ISODATA requires number of clusters, and a number of additional user-supplied parameters as inputs. To get better results user need to initialize these parameters with appropriate values by analyzing the input microarray data. In [10] Karteeka Pavan et al proposed AGMFI algorithm to initialize merge factor for ISODATA. This paper studies an initialization of centroids proposed in [17] for microarray data to get the best quality of clusters. A comparative analysis is performed for UCI data sets inorder to get the best clustering algorithm.\nThis paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of Existing works K-Means algorithm, Automatic Generation of Merge Factor for ISODATA (AGMFI) methods. Section 3 describes the Enhanced initialization algorithm. Section 4 describes performance study of the above methods for UCI data sets. Section 5 describes the conclusion and future work."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "2.1 K- Means Clustering\nThe main objective in cluster analysis is to group objects that are similar in one cluster and separate objects that are dissimilar by assigning them to different clusters. One of the most popular clustering methods is K-Means clustering algorithm [3, 9, 12, 17]. It classifies object to a pre-defined number of clusters, which is given by the user (assume K clusters). The idea is to choose random cluster centres, one for each cluster. These centres are preferred to be as far as possible from each other. In this algorithm mostly Euclidean distance is used to find distance between data points and centroids [6]. The Euclidean distance between two multi-dimensional data points X = (x1, x2, x3, ..., xm) and Y = (y1, y2, y3, ..., ym) is described as follows:\nD(X,Y) =\ufffd(\ud835\udc651 \u2212 \ud835\udc661)2 + (\ud835\udc652 \u2212 \ud835\udc662)2 + \u22ef+ (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a \u2212 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a)2 The K-Means method aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between all points and the cluster centre. This procedure consists of the following steps, as described below. _______________________________________________ Algorithm 1: K-Means clustering algorithm [17] Require: D = {d1, d2, d3, ..., dn } // Set of n data points. K - Number of desired clusters Ensure: A set of K clusters."}, {"heading": "Steps:", "text": "1. Arbitrarily choose k data points from D as initial centroids; 2. Repeat Assign each point di to the cluster which has the closest centroid; Calculate the new mean for each cluster; Until convergence criteria is met. Though the K-Means algorithm is simple, it has some drawbacks of quality of the final clustering, since it highly depends on the arbitrary selection of the initial centroids [1].\n2.2 Automatic Generation of Merge Factor for ISODATA (AGMFI) Algorithm\nThe clusters produced in the K-Means clustering are further optimized by ISODATA algorithm. Some of the parameters are fixed by user during the merging and partitioning the clusters. In [10], Automatic Generation of Merge Factor is proposed to initialize merge factor for ISODATA. AGMFI uses different heuristics to determine when to split. Decision of merging is done based upon merge factor which is the function of distances between the clusters. The step by step procedure of AGMFI is given here under. _______________________________________________ Algorithm 3: The AGMFI algorithm [10] Require: D = {d1, d2, d3, ..., dn } // Set of n data points. K - Number of desired clusters. m- minimum number of samples in a cluster. N \u2013 maximum number of iterations. \u0398s \u2013 a threshold value for spilt_size. \u0398c - a threshold value for merge_size. Ensure: A set of K clusters. Steps: 1. Identify clusters using K-Means algorithms; 2. Find the inter distance in all other cluster to minimum average inter distances clusters point in C; 3. Discard the m and merging operations of cluster \u2265 2*K, If n is even go to step 4 or 5; 4. Distance between two centroids < C, merge the Cluster and update centroid, otherwise repeat up to K/2 times; 5. K \u2264 K/2 or n is odd go to step 6 or 7; 6. Find the standard division of all clusters that has exceeds S * standard division of D; 7. Executed N times or no changes occurred in clusters since the last time then stop, otherwise take the centroids of the clusters as new seed points and find the clusters using K-Means and go to step 3.\nThe main difference between AGMFI and ISODATA is ISODATA uses heuristic values to merge the clusters, AGMFI generates automatically and the choice of c is not fixed but is to be decided to have better performance. The distance measure used here is the Euclidean distance. To assess the quality of the clusters, we used the silhouette measure proposed by Rousseeuw [14]. 3. The Enhanced Method\nPerformance of iterative clustering algorithms which converges to numerous local minima depends highly on initial cluster centers. Generally initial cluster centers are selected randomly. In this section, the cluster centre initialization algorithm is studied to improve the performance of the K-Means algorithm. _______________________________________________ Algorithm 2: The Enhanced Method [17] Require: D = {d1, d2, d3,..., di,..., dn } // Set of n data points. di = { x1, x2, x3,..., xi,..., xm } // Set of attributes of one data point. k // Number of desired clusters. Ensure: A set of k clusters."}, {"heading": "Steps:", "text": "1. In the given data set D, if the data points contains the both positive and negative attribute values then go to Step 2, otherwise go to step 4. 2. Find the minimum attribute value in the given data set D. 3. For each data point attribute, subtract with the minimum attribute value. 4. For each data point calculate the distance from origin. 5. Sort the distances obtained in step 4. Sort the data points accordance with the distances. 6. Partition the sorted data points into k equal sets. 7. In each set, take the middle point as the initial centroid. 8. Compute the distance between each data point di (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) to all the initial centroids cj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 k). 9.

For each cluster j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 k), recalculate the centroids. 14. For each data point di, 14.1 Compute its distance from the centroid of the present nearest cluster. 14.2 If this distance is less than or equal to the present nearest distance, the data point stays in the same cluster. Else 14.2.1 For every centroid cj (1\u2264 j \u2264 k) compute the distance d(di, cj). End for; Until the convergence criteria is met. _______________________________________________\n4.
