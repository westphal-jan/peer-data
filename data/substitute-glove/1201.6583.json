A common view is that intelligent behavior can be \u201cengineered\u201d; either by fully hand-coding all the necessary rules into the agent, or by relying on various optimizationbased techniques to automatically generate it. For example, in modern control and dynamic programming a human designer specifies a performance signal which explicitly or implicitly encodes goals of the agent. By behaving in a way that optimizes this quantity, the agent then does what the programmer wants it to do. For many applications, this is a perfectly reasonable approach that can lead to impressive results. However, it typically requires some prior knowledge and sometimes subtle design by the human developer to achieve sensible or desirable results.\nIn this paper, we investigate an approach to use the \u201cembodiment\u201d of an agent (i.e., the dynamics of its coupling to the environment) to generate preferred behaviors without having to resort to specialized, hand-designed solutions that vary from task to task. Our research embraces the related ideas of self-organization and self-regulation, where we aim for complex behavior to derive from simple and generic internal rules. The philosophy is that seemingly intentional and goal-driven behavior emerges as the by-product of the agent trying to satisfy universal rules rather than from optimizing externally defined rewards. Examples of this kind of work include homeokinesis (Ay, Bertschinger, Der, Gu\u0308ttler, & Olbrich, 2008; Der, Steinmetz, & Pasemann, 1999; Der, 2000, 2001; Zahedi, Ay, & Der, 2010), or the work in (Still, 2009). The second idea is that of intrinsically motivated behavior and artificial curiosity (Schmidhuber, 1991), where an agent engages in behavior because it is inherently \u201cinteresting\u201d or \u201cenjoyable\u201d, rather than as a step towards solving a specific (externally defined) goal. Intrinsically motivated behavior may not directly help in solving a goal, but there are indications that it leads to exploration and allows an agent to acquire a broad range of abilities which can, once the need arises, be easily molded into goal-directed behavior. Related relevant publications include, for example, (Singh, Barto, & Chentanez, 2005). Other related work can be found in (Lungarella, Pegors, Bulwinkle, & Sporns, 2005; Lungarella & Sporns, 2005; Sporns & Lungarella, 2006; Lungarella & Sporns, 2006) and (Prokopenko, Gerasimov, & Tanev, 2006; Steels, 2004; Kaplan & Oudeyer, 2004).\nHere we will consider the principle of empowerment (Klyubin, Polani, & Nehaniv, 2005a, 2008), an information-theoretic quantity which is defined as the channel capacity between an agent\u2019s actions and its sensory observations in subsequent time steps. Empowerment can be regarded as \u201cuniversal utility\u201d which defines an a priori intrinsic reward or rather, a value/utility for the states in which an agent finds itself in. Empowerment is fully specified by the dynamics of the agent-environment coupling (namely the transition probabilities); a reward does not need to be specified. It was hypothesized in (Klyubin et al., 2005a, 2008) that the greedy maximization of empowerment would direct an agent to \u201cinteresting\u201d states in a variety of scenarios:\n\u2022 For one, empowerment can be considered a stochastic generalization of the concept of mobility (i.e., number of options available to an agent) which is a powerful heuristic in many deterministic and discrete puzzles and games. Being in a state with high empowerment gives an agent a wide choice of actions \u2014 conversely, if an agent in \u201cdefault mode\u201d poises itself a priori in a highempowerment state, it is best equipped to quickly move from there into a variety of target states in an emergency (for example, in the game of soccer, a goalkeeper who is about to receive a penalty kick and has no prior knowledge about the player behavior to expect naturally positions himself in the middle of the goal). In this regard the quantity of empowerment allows an agent to automatically (without explicit external human input) identify those states, even in complex environments.\n\u2022 In the present paper we show that, for a certain class of continuous control problems, empowerment provides a natural utility function which imbues its states with an a priori value, without an\n3 explicit specification of a reward. Such problems are typically those where one tries to keep a system \u201calive\u201d indefinitely, i.e., in a certain goal region for as long a time as possible. On the other hand, choosing the wrong actions or doing nothing would instead lead to the \u201cdeath\u201d of the system (naturally represented by zero empowerment). A natural example is pole-balancing. 1 In this context, we will find the smoothness of the system informs the local empowerment gradients around the agent\u2019s state of where the most \u201calive\u201d states are. Choosing actions such that the local empowerment score is maximized would then lead the agent into those states. In the pole-balancing example this means that for a wide range of initial conditions, the agent would be made to balance the pendulum.\nPrevious studies with empowerment showed promise in various domains but were essentially limited to the case of small-scale and finite-state domains (the ubiquitous gridworld) and furthermore, state transition probabilities were assumed to be known a priori. The main contribution of this article is to extend previous work to the significantly more important case of (1) continuous vector-valued state spaces and (2) initially unknown state transition probabilities. The first property means that we will be able to calculate empowerment values only approximately; more specifically, here we will use MonteCarlo approximation to evaluate the integral underlying the empowerment computation. The second property considers the case where the state space is previously unexplored and implies that the agent has to use some form of online model learning to estimate transition probabilities from state-actionsuccessor state triplets it encounters while interacting with the environment. Here, we will approach model learning using Gaussian process regression with iterated forecasting.\nTo summarize, the paper is structured into three parts as follows:\n1. The first part, Section 2, gives a first, informal definition of empowerment and illustrates its general properties in a well-known finite-state domain.\n2. The second part forms the main technical portion. Section 3 starts with a formal definition of empowerment for the continuous case and gives an algorithm for its computation based on MonteCarlo approximation of the underlying high-dimensional integrals. Section 4 describes model learning using Gaussian process regression (GPs) \u2013 however, since this itself is a rather complex subject matter, for brevity here we cannot go beyond a high-level description.\n3. The third part examines empowerment empirically in a number of continuous control tasks well known in the area of reinforcement learning. The experiments will demonstrate how empowerment can form a natural utility measure, and how states with high empowerment values coincide with the natural (and intuitive) choice of a goal state in the respective domain. This way, if we incorporate empowerment into the perception-action loop of an agent, e.g., by greedily choosing actions that lead to the highest empowered states, we can obtain a seemingly goal-driven behavior. As an application of this, we study the problem of exploration and model learning: using empowerment to guide which parts of the state-space to exlore next, the agent can quickly \u201cdiscover the goal\u201d and thus more efficiently explore the environment \u2013 without exhaustively sampling the state space."}, {"heading": "2 Illustrative example", "text": "Although a more formal definition of empowerment will follow in the next section, here we will start by motivating it through a toy example. Informally, empowerment computes for any state of the environment\n1Empowerment in the pole-balancing example was first investigated in (Klyubin et al., 2008) with a discretized state space and a priori known state transition probabilities. Here we will strongly extend this example to the continuous case and online learning. State transition probabilities are initially not known. Instead, the agent has to learn the transition probabilities while interacting with the environment.\n4 the logarithm of the effective number of successor states the agent can induce by its actions. Thus empowerment essentially measures to what extent an agent can influence the environment by its actions: it is zero if, regardless what the agent does, the outcome will be the same. And it is maximal if every action will have a distinct2 outcome. Note that empowerment is specifically designed to allow for more general stochastic environments, of which deterministic transitions are just a special case.\nY\nR G\nB\nAs an example, consider the taxi-domain (Dietterich, 1998), a well-known problem in reinforcement learning with finite state and action space and stochastic transitions. The environment, shown on the left, consists of a 5\u00d7 5 gridworld with four special locations designated \u2019R\u2019,\u2019Y\u2019,\u2019G\u2019,\u2019B\u2019. Apart from the agent (\u201cthe taxi\u201d), there is a passenger who wants to get from one of the four locations to another (selected at random). The state of the system is the x, y coordinate of the agent, the location of the passenger (one of \u2019R\u2019,\u2019Y\u2019,\u2019G\u2019,\u2019B\u2019,\u2019in-the-car\u2019) and its destination (one of\n\u2019R\u2019,\u2019Y\u2019,\u2019G\u2019,\u2019B\u2019). Overall there are 500 = 5\u00d7 5\u00d7 5\u00d7 4 distinct states. Usually in RL, where the interest is on abstraction and hierarchical learning, a factored representation of the state is used that explicitly exploits the structure of the domain. For our purpose, where identifying salient states is part of the problem, we do not assume that the structure of the domain is known and will use a flat representation instead. The agent has six possible elementary actions: the first four (\u2019N\u2019,\u2019S\u2019,E\u2019,\u2019W\u2019) move the agent in the indicated direction (stochastically, there is a 20% chance for random movement). If the resulting direction is blocked by a wall, no movement occurs. The agent can also issue a pick-up and drop-off action, which require that the taxi is at the correct location and (in the latter case) the passenger is in the car. Issuing pick-up and drop-off when the conditions are not met does not result in any changes. If a passenger is successfully delivered, the environment is reset: the agent is placed in the center and a passenger with new start and destination is generated.\nUsing these state transition dynamics, we compute the 3-step empowerment, i.e., the effective number of successor states reachable over an action horizon of 3 steps (meaning we consider compound actions of a sequence of three elementary actions) for every state of the system. Figure 1 shows some of the results: the values are ordered such that every subplot shows the empowerment values that correspond to a specific slice of the state space. For example, the top left subplot shows the empowerment value of all x, y locations if the passenger is waiting at \u2019Y\u2019 and its destination is \u2019G\u2019, which with our labeling of the states corresponds to states 376-400. Inspecting the plots, two things become apparent: for one, in general, locations in the center have high empowerment (because the agent has freedom to move wherever it wants); locations in the corners have low empowerment (because the agent has only limited choices of what it can do). More interesting is the empowerment value at the designated locations: if a passenger is waiting at a certain location, its empowerment, and that of its neighbors 2 steps away, increases. Similarly, if a passenger is in the car, the empowerment of the destination, and that of its neighbors 2 steps away, increases. The reason is that in both situations the agent now has additional, previously unavailable, ways of affecting the environment (plot (c) and (d) have a higher relative gain in empowerment, because they result in the end of an episode, which teleports the agent to the center). Thus these states stand out as being \u201cinteresting\u201d under the heuristic of empowerment. Incidentally, these are also exactly the subgoal states if the agent\u2019s task were to transport the passenger from source to destination. Note that here we did not have to specify external reward or goals, as empowerment is intrinsically computed from the transition dynamics alone.\nEmpowerment essentially \u201cdiscovers\u201d states where additional degrees of freedom are available, and creates a basin of attraction around them, indicating salient features of the environment of interest to the agent. It is not difficult to imagine an agent that uses empowerment as a guiding principle for exploration; e.g., by choosing in each state greedily the action that leads to the successor state with the highest empowerment. We expect that such an agent would traverse the state space in a far more sensible\n2Meaning that for discrete state spaces, the sets of successor states are disjoint for differerent actions; for continuous state spaces, the domains of the underlying pdfs are non-overlapping.\nway than blind random exploration, as following the trail of increasing empowerment would quickly lead to the discovery of the salient states in the environment. In the remainder of the paper, we will develop methods for carrying over this idea into the continuum and demonstrate how empowerment supersedes typical hand-designed rewards in a number of established benchmark domains."}, {"heading": "3 Computation of empowerment", "text": "This section defines empowerment formally and gives an algorithm for its computation."}, {"heading": "3.1 General definition of empowerment", "text": "Empowerment (Klyubin et al., 2005a) is defined for stochastic dynamic systems where transitions arise as the result of making a decision, e.g. such as an agent interacting with an environment. Here we will assume a vector-valued state space X \u2282 RD and (for simplicity) a discrete action space A = {1, . . . , NA}. The transition function is given in terms of a density3 p(xt+1|xt, at) which denotes the probability of going from state xt to xt+1 when making decision at. While we assume the system is fully defined in terms of these 1-step interactions, we will also be interested in more general n-step interactions. Thus, for n \u2265 1, we consider the sequence ~ant = (at, . . . , at+n\u22121) of n single-step actions and the induced probability density p(xt+n|xt,~ant ) of making the corresponding n-step transition.\nFor notational convenience we can assume that, without loss of generality, 1-step and n-step actions are equivalent: let the set of possible n-step actions be formed through exhaustive enumeration of all possible combinations of 1-step actions. If NA is the number of possible 1-step actions in every state, the number of n-step actions is then Nn := (NA)n. With this approach, we can consider the system as evolving at the time-scale of n-step actions, so that n-step actions can be regarded as 1-step actions at a higher level of decision making. This abstraction allows us to treat 1-step and n-step actions on equal footing, which we will use to simplify the notation and drop references to the time index. Instead of writing p(xt+n|xt,~ant ) we will now just write p(x\n\u2032|x,~a) to denote the transition from x to x\u2032 under ~a, irrespective of whether ~a is an n-step action or 1-step action. Furthermore we will use the symbol \u03bd to loop over actions ~a.\nLet X \u2032 denote the random variable associated with x\u2032 given x. Assume that the choice of a particular action ~a is also random and modeled by random variable A. The empowerment C(x) of a state x\n3Note that we have to consider stochastic transitions in the continuum. Otherwise if, for every action, the resulting successor states are distinct, empowerment always attains the maximum value. In practice this will usually be the case when simulating continuous control tasks with deterministic dynamics. In this case we artificially add some zero mean Gaussian noise with small variance (see Section 5.2). This can be interpreted as modeling limited action or sensoric resolution, depending on the take. It is also a natural assumption for a robot realized in hardware.\n(more precisely, the n-step empowerment) is then defined as the Shannon channel capacity (using the differential entropy) between A, the choice of an action sequence, and X \u2032, the resulting successor state:\nC(x) := max p(~a)\nI(X \u2032;A |x)\n= max p(~a)\n{ H(X \u2032 |x)\u2212H(X \u2032 | A,x) } . (1)\nThe maximization of the mutual information is with respect to all possible distributions over A, which in our case means vectors of length Nn of probabilities. The entropy and conditional entropy are given by\nH(X \u2032|x) := \u2212\n\u222b\nX\np(x\u2032|x) log p(x\u2032|x)dx\u2032 (2)\nH(X \u2032|A,x) := Nn \u2211\n\u03bd=1\np(~a\u03bd)H(X \u2032|A = ~a\u03bd ,x)\n= \u2212 Nn \u2211\n\u03bd=1\np(~a\u03bd)\n\u222b\nX\np(x\u2032|x,~a\u03bd) \u00b7 log p(x \u2032|x,~a\u03bd)dx \u2032. (3)\nStrictly speaking, the entropies in Eqs. (2) and (3) are differential entropies (which could be negative) and the probabilities are to be read as probability densities. However, as we always end up using the mutual information, i.e. the difference between the entropies, we end up with well-defined non-negative information values which are always finite due to the limited resolution/noise assumed above. Using p(x\u2032|x) =\n\u2211Nn i=1 p(x \u2032|x,~ai)p(~ai) in Eqs. (2) and (3), Eq. (1) can thus be written as\nC(x) := max p(~a)\nNn \u2211\n\u03bd=1\np(~a\u03bd)\n\u222b\nX\np(x\u2032|x,~a\u03bd) \u00b7 log\n{\np(x\u2032|x,~a\u03bd) \u2211Nn\ni=1 p(x \u2032|x,~ai)p(~ai)\n}\ndx\u2032 (4)\nHence, given the density p(x\u2032|x,~a\u03bd) for making n-step transitions, empowerment is a function C : X \u2192 R\u22650 that maps an arbitrary state x to its empowerment C(x)."}, {"heading": "3.2 A concrete numerical example", "text": "Before we proceed, let us make the previous definition more concrete by looking at a numerical example. To simplify the exposition, the example will be discrete (thus integration over the domain is replaced\n7 by summation). We consider an agent in an environment with three states, labeled #1,#2,#3, and two possible actions, denoted A or D. The dynamics of the environment is fully described by the 1-step transitions shown in Figure 2(left). The right side of the figure shows the corresponding 2-step transitions which are derived from the 1-step transitions; for example, the entry p(x\u2032 = #1|x = #1, a = (AA)) is obtained by\np(x\u2032 = #1|x = #1, a = (AA)) =\n#3 \u2211\ni=#1\np(x\u2032 = #1|x = i, a = A) \u00b7 p(x\u2032 = i|x = 1, a = A)\n= (.9 \u00d7 .9) + (.1\u00d7 0) + (0\u00d7 0) = .81.\nLet us now assume we want to calculate the 2-step empowerment value C(#1) for state x = #1. First, consider the 2-step mutual information, I(X \u2032;A|x = #1), for state x = #1. According to Eq. (1), we have\nI(X \u2032;A|x = #1) = p(AA) \u00b7\n#3 \u2211\ni=#1\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = AA) log\n{\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = AA)\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1)\n}\n+ p(AD) \u00b7\n#3 \u2211\ni=#1\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = AD) log\n{\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = AD)\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1)\n}\n+ p(DA) \u00b7\n#3 \u2211\ni=#1\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = DA) log\n{\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = DA)\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1)\n}\n+ p(DD) \u00b7\n#3 \u2211\ni=#1\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = DD) log\n{\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = DD)\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1)\n}\n.\nThe denominator in the logarithm is calculated for any i via:\np(x\u2032 = i|x = #1) = p(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = AA) \u00b7 p(AA)\n+ p(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = AD) \u00b7 p(AD)\n+ p(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = DA) \u00b7 p(DA)\n+ p(x\u2032 = i|x = #1, a = DD) \u00b7 p(DD)\nAs we can see, the resulting value for I(X \u2032;A|x = #1) will only depend on the individual probabilities of the actions, p(AA), p(AD), p(DA), p(DD), but not on the transition probabilities as these are fixed for a given environment. One natural choice for the action probabilities could be the uniform distribution. However, for empowerment we try to find an assignment of action probabilities such that the resulting I(X \u2032;A) value is maximimized among all possible assignments (an algorithm for this will be given in the next section). Below we have calculated the empowerment values MI (taking uniform distribution over actions) and Em (taking the maximizing distribution over actions) in our example for various time horizons, i.e., 1-step, 2-step, etc. Note that, while empowerment values are logarithmic, for the purpose of illustration the results are given in terms of exp(I(X \u2032;A)):\n1-step 2-step 3-step 4-step 5-step State MI Em MI Em MI Em MI Em MI Em\nx = #1 1.70 1.71 1.93 2.17 1.81 2.10 1.58 2.05 1.38 2.02 x = #2 2 2 1.75 2 1.45 2 1.26 2 1.14 2 x = #3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 The first column, 1-step, illustrates the full range of possible empowerment values. Empowerment in state #3 is zero (here, 1 = exp(0)), because all actions in #3 have the same outcome. Empowerment in state #2 is maximal (here 2, corresponding to the two possible 1-step actions), because each action in #2 has a different outcome. In state #1 the set of successor states overlap, thus the empowerment value is in between the two extremes.\nAs the time horizon increases, we can make the following observations. One is that the empowerment value of #3 always stays at zero, because no matter what the agent does, the outcome will be the same (thus absorbing states are \u201cdead\u201d states). Two, the MI value of #2 goes down, whereas its Em value stays constant (this in fact is an important observation). The reason is that, as the time horizon increases, so does the number of possible (n-step) actions, e.g., 32 = 25 for 5 steps. However, a large number of these actions will bring the agent into #3 from which it cannot escape. Therefore, if all actions contribute in equal parts to the result (which they do in MI, where we assume a uniform distribution), those that lead to zero empowerment will dominate and thus also the end result will be close to zero. On the other hand, the maximization in Em will suppress the effect of indistinguishable actions (assigning zero probability to actions having the same outcome and high probabilities to actions having distinct outcomes) and thus ensure that the two distinct choices in #2 are always correctly identified."}, {"heading": "3.3 Empowerment or mutual information?", "text": "Let us summarize. Empowerment measures to what extent an agent can influence the environment by its actions. It specifically works for stochastic systems (where state transitions are given in terms of probabilities), but can also apply to deterministic systems (which are just a special case of stochastic systems). Empowerment is zero if, regardless what the agent does, the outcome will be the same (i.e., the outcome distribution for a given successor state x\u2032 is independent of the action). And it is maximal if every action will have a distinct outcome (i.e., the probability that a single outcome is produced by two different actions is zero).\nLet us now briefly discuss why the related information-theoretic quantity mutual information, which would largely have the same properties and would be easier to compute, is not as powerful as channel capacity at identifying interesting states of the environment.\n21\n...\na1 a2 a99\na100\nFirst, let us comment that to use the idea of modeling the influence of the action channel, one has to define some kind of distribution on the actions. As we are considering only an agent\u2019s embodiment, but have not defined a controller, there is no default action distribution that one could use. Therefore, one has to distinguish particular action distributions for which the action channel is to be measured. The main natural choices\nare the choice of an action distribution that is equally distributed, not singling out any particular action, and that one which maximizes I(X \u2032;A), i.e. the one that achieves channel capacity. As we have seen in the last section, the equidistribution of actions can fail to resolve important properties of the action channel which the optimal distribution does detect. The most obvious situation is one where one has a large number of equivalent actions. If mutual information assumes a uniform distribution over actions, it will be mislead by large numbers of actions that lead to the same outcome. As another example, consider the following situation. Assume an agent has 100 different actions available and is in a state where every action has the same effect (empowerment and mutual information both zero). Now let us assume the agent enters a new state, as shown on the left side, where actions a1 to a99 still have the same outcome (state 1), but one action a100 leads to a different state (state 2). In this case, use of mutual information with equidistributed would still be close to zero (\u2248 0.05 nats), indicating that all actions roughly have the same effect, whereas empowerment correctly identifies two distinct choices (\u2248 0.69 = log(2) nats) since it will redistribute the actions in a way that highlights the additional degrees of freedom attained by a100.\n9"}, {"heading": "3.4 Computing empowerment when a model is available", "text": "Next we describe the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for computing the channel capacity given in Eq.

Instead, we assume that we could only observe a number of 1-step transitions which are given as triplets of state, performed action, and resulting successor state. Using regression on these samples, we first infer a 1-step transition model. Proceeding from this 1-step model we can then obtain a more general n-step transition model through iteratively predicting n steps ahead in time.\nIn general, there would be many ways the task of regression could be accomplished. Here we will use Gaussian process regression (GP) (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006). GPs are simple and mathematically elegant, yet very powerful tools that offer some considerable advantages. One is that GPs directly produce a predictive distribution over the target values, which is exactly what is needed in Eq. (4) for the computation of empowerment. Furthermore, the predictive distribution is Gaussian and hence easy to draw samples from during the Monte-Carlo approximation (see Section 3.4.3). Also, GPs are nonparametric, meaning that a GP model is not restricted to a certain class of functions (such as polynomials), but instead encompasses all functions sharing the same degree of smoothness. In practice GPs are also very easy to use: the solution can be found analytically and in closed form. The Bayesian framework allows us to nicely address the problem of hyperparameter selection in a principled way, which makes the process of using GPs virtually fully automated, i.e. without having to adjust a single parameter by hand."}, {"heading": "4.1 Learning 1-step system dynamics", "text": "To learn the state transition probabilities p(x\u2032|x, a = \u03bd), i.e. predict the successor state x\u2032 when performing 1-step action a = \u03bd in state x, we combine multiple univariate GPs. Each individual GP\u03bdj , where j = 1 . . . D and \u03bd = 1 . . . NA, predicts the j-th coordinate of successor state x\u2032 under action a = \u03bd. Each individual GP\u03bdj is trained independently on the subset of the transitions where action \u03bd was chosen: the desired target outputs we regress on is the change in the state variables (i.e. we predict the difference xt+1\u2212xt). Since both state variables and actions are treated separately, we need a total of D \u00b7NA independent GPs.\nA detailed description of how univariate regression with GPs work4 can be found in (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006). Training GP\u03bdj gives us a distribution p(x\u2032j|x, a = \u03bd) = N (\u00b5\u03bdj(x), \u03c3 2 \u03bdj(x)) for the j-th variable of the successor state, where the exact equations for the mean \u00b5\u03bdj(x) and variance \u03c32\u03bdj(x) can be found in (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006).

See Figure 3 for an illustration of this situation.\n4There is also the problem of implementing GPs efficiently when dealing with a possible large number of data points. For brevity we will only sketch our particular implementation, see (Quin\u0303onero-Candela, Rasmussen, & Williams, 2007) for more detailed information. Our GP implementation is based on the subset of regressors approximation. The elements of the subset are chosen by a stepwise greedy procedure aimed at minimizing the error incurred from using a low rank approximation (incomplete Cholesky decomposition). Optimization of the likelihood is done on random subsets of the data of fixed size. To avoid a degenerate predictive variance, the projected process approximation was used.\n12\n4.2 From 1-step to n-step models\nTo turn the 1-step model into an n-step model p(xt+n|xt,~ant ), where ~a n t = (at, at+1, . . . , at+n\u22121) is a sequence of n 1-step actions, we have to integrate over all intermediate distributions. Unfortunately, solving this integral analytically in closed form is not possible. One simple approach is again to use sampling methods, like the Monte-Carlo approximation, to numerically determine the integral. Alternatively, one could consider a more sophisticated approximate solution based on the Laplace approximation, as was proposed in (Girard, Rasmussen, Quin\u0303onero-Candela, & Murray-Smith, 2003).\nSince, in our experiments, we will only consider very short prediction horizons (typically n = 3 or n = 5), we will use the more naive approach of predicting iteratively n steps ahead using the learned 1-step model. Given state xt, we apply Eq. (11) to produce p(xt+1|xt, at). Instead of considering the full distribution, we just take its mean x\u0302t+1 := \u00b5at(xt) as point estimate and use that to predict xt+2, applying again the 1-step model Eq. (11) to produce p(xt+2|x\u0302t+1, at+1). Repeating this procedure until the end of the prediction horizon is reached, we obtain after n steps p(xt+n|x\u0302t+n\u22121, at+n\u22121) as an approximation to the originally sought n-step transition model p(xt+n|xt,~ant ). In general, this approximation will tend to underestimate the variance of the prediction and produce a slightly different mean, since every time we produce an estimate for t+ i, we ignore the uncertainty in the preceding prediction for t + i \u2212 1. In our case, however, the procedure will incur only a neglible error since the prediction horizon we consider is very short. See (Girard et al., 2003) for more details."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We have indicated earlier that empowerment has shown intuitively appealing identification of salient states in discrete scenarios and we are now ready to study a number of more intricate continuous scenar-\n13\nios. These scenarios are used as benchmark for typical learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning or optimal control). However, it should be noted that in the latter the learning algorithms need to be instructed about which optimization criterion to use in the learning process. Here, we will always use empowerment maximization as the criterion, and demonstrate that the resulting behaviors actually match closely those where optimization of an external quality criterion is requested. The observation that these behaviors match, is a subtle point and will be discussed in more detail in the discussion (see Section 6).\nAs an important side effect, empowerment can also be used as a (heuristic) exploration driver in these scenarios: this is particularly interesting since, unlike optimal control algorithms, empowerment is fundamentally local (limited to the horizon defined by the actions) as opposed to optimal control algorithms that, for an informed decision, need to have their horizon extended to encompass information about the desired target state(s) to a sufficiently accurate extent.\nThus, in the following section, we will demonstrate that\n1. empowerment alone can lead to apparently intentional and goal-directed behavior of an agent based only on the embodiment of the agent with no external reward structure, and\n2. how it can furthermore act as a heuristic to guide the agent\u2019s exploration of the environment.\nWe consider two scenarios: one without model learning, and one with model learning. The first scenario will demonstrate that incorporating empowerment into the perception-action loop of an agent produces intuitively desirable behavior, by greedily choosing actions in each state that lead to the highest empowered states. Our primary intent here is to show that empowerment itself is a relevant quantity to be considered and for simplicity we assume that the transition probabilities of the system are known. In the second scenario, we will further reduce our assumptions and consider this no longer to be the case. The agent starts out knowing nothing about the environment it is in. We will then combine empowerment with model learning and exploration: while, as in the first scenario, the agent chooses its actions based on empowerment, the underlying computations are carried out using a learned model for the state transition probabilities. The model is continually updated (in batches) from the transitions the agent experiences and thus gets continually better at predicting the effects the actions will have, which in turn will produce more accurate empowerment values. A comparison with common model-based reinforcement learning, RMAX (Brafman & Tennenholtz, 2002), which operates in a similar fashion but actively optimizes an external performance criterion, concludes."}, {"heading": "5.1 The domains", "text": "As testbeds for our experiments, we consider simulations of the three physical systems described below. We reiterate that, in the literature, systems like these are usually used in the context of control and learning behavior where a goal (desired target states) is externally defined and, by optimizing a thus determined performance criterion, the system is driven to specifically reach that goal. In contrast, empowerment used here is a generic heuristic (aimed at curiosity-driven learning) where a goal is not explicitly defined and which operates on innate characteristics of the system\u2019s dynamic alone. It will turn out that empowerment intrinsically drives the system (close) to states which in fact are typically externally chosen as goal states. However, with empowerment we do not enforce this goal through any external reward but through a generic intrinsic quantity that, for each domain, is generated in exactly the same way. Note that, in a wider sense, all the tasks belong to the class of control problems where the goal is to choose actions such that the system stays \u201calive\u201d \u2013 to achieve this, the agent has to stay in a certain \u201cstable\u201d goal region. This is a class of problems for which we believe empowerment is particularly well-suited.\nInverted pendulum: The first system consists of a single pole attached at one end to a motor, as depicted in Figure 4. If force is applied, the pole will freely swing in the xy plane. More detailed\n14\ndynamic equations of the system are given in the appendix. If no force is applied, the system returns to its stable equilibrium (pole hangs down vertically). Let this state be the initial condition. The goal is to swing up and stabilize the pole in the inverted position. However, the motor does not provide enough torque to do so directly in a single rotation. Instead, the pendulum needs to be swung back and forth to gather energy, before being pushed up and balanced. This creates a somewhat difficult, nonlinear control problem. The state space is 2-dimensional, \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] being the angle, \u03c6\u0307 \u2208 [\u221210, 10] the angular velocity. Since our empowerment model only deals with a finite number of 1-step and n-step actions, the control force is discretized to a \u2208 {\u22125,\u22120.25, 0, 0,+0.25,+0.5}.\nRiding a bicycle: The second domain is a more involved one: we consider the bicycle riding task described in (Lagoudakis & Parr, 2003; Ernst, Geurts, & Wehenkel, 2005) and depicted in Figure 4. In this task, a bicycle-rider system (modeled as a simplified mechanical system) moves at a constant speed on a horizontal surface. The bicycle is not self-stabilizing and has to be actively stabilized to be prevented from falling. The goal is to keep the bicycle stable such that it continues to move forward indefinitely. A detailed description of the dynamics of the system is given in the appendix. The problem is 4-dimensional: state variables are the roll angle \u03c9 \u2208 [\u221212\u03c0/180, 12\u03c0/180], roll rate \u03c9\u0307 \u2208 [\u22122\u03c0, 2\u03c0], angle of the handlebar \u03b1 \u2208 [\u221280\u03c0/180, 80\u03c0/180], and the angular velocity \u03b1\u0307 \u2208 [\u22122\u03c0, 2\u03c0]. The control space is inherently 2-dimensional: u1, the horizontal displacement of the bicycle-rider system from the vertical plane, and u2, turning the handlebar from the neutral position. Since empowerment can only deal with a finite number of 1-step and n-step actions, we consider 5 possible action vectors: (u1, u2) \u2208 {(\u22120.02, 0), (0, 0), (0.02, 0), (0,\u22122), (0, 2)}.\nAcrobot: The third domain is the acrobot proposed in (Spong, 1995). The acrobot can be imagined as a gymnast swinging up above a high bar by bending at the hips. As depicted in Figure 4, the acrobot is a two-link robot, which freely swings around the first joint (the hands grasping the bar) and can exert force only at the second joint (the hips). Controlling the acrobot is a very challenging problem in nonlinear control; it is underactuated, meaning that the dimensionality of the state space is higher than that of the actuators, or, informally, that it has more degrees of freedom than actuators (in robotics, many systems are underactuated, including manipulator arms on spacecraft, non-rigid body systems, and balancing systems such as dynamically stable legged robots). Usually two tasks are considered for the acrobot in the literature: the first and easier one is to swing the tip (the feet) of the lower link over the bar at the height of the upper link. The second task is significantly more difficult: as in the first task, the goal is to swing up the lower link; however, this time the acrobot has to reach the inverted handstand position with close to zero velocity, and then to actively balance so as to remain in this highly unstable state for as long as possible. A detailed description of the dynamics of the system is given in the appendix. The initial state of the acrobot is the stable equilibrium with both links hanging vertically down. The state space is 4-dimensional: \u03b81 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0], \u03b8\u03071 \u2208 [\u22124\u03c0, 4\u03c0], \u03b82 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0], \u03b8\u03072 \u2208 [\u22129\u03c0, 9\u03c0]. Since, as before, empowerment can deal with only a finite number of 1-step and n-step actions, the continuous control was discretized to a \u2208 {\u22121,+1}. However, while these two actions alone are sufficient to solve the swing-up task, they are not sufficient for the inverted balance, since for this case, control values between the two extremes \u22121 and +1 must be chosen. Therefore, we include a third, nonprimitive \u2019balance\u2019 action, which chooses control values derived from an LQR controller obtained from linearizing the system dynamics about the handstand position (see appendix). Note that this \u2019balance\u2019 action produces meaningful (i.e., actually useful) outputs only very close to the handstand state which means that it cannot be naively used to direct the acrobot to balance from an arbitrary point of the state space.\n15"}, {"heading": "5.2 First scenario: model-based", "text": "In our first series of experiments, the agent chooses actions greedily to maximize empowerment. For all domains, we assume that the state transition probabilities are known. The control loop becomes the following: every time step t the agent observes the current state xt. Using the state transition function, we determine the 1-step successor states under each of the possible 1-step actions. For each of these states, we compute the empowerment value as described in Section 3.4.3, using NMC = 200, TOL = 10\u22125 and MAX ITER = 150, and adding Gaussian white noise with (state-independent) covariance to \u201csmear out\u201d the otherwise deterministic state transitions. The agent then executes the action corresponding to the successor state with the highest empowerment value (empowerment-greedy action selection), advancing the time and producing the next state xt+1.\nNote that in practice, for empowerment values to be meaningful, we usually require an increased look-ahead horizon into the future than just a single simulation step; thus, instead of 1-step empowerment, we usually need to examine n-step empowerment for values of n greater than one. Here we form the n-step actions through exhaustive enumeration; thus if NA is the number of possible 1-actions the agent has available, the number Nn of n-step actions we have to consider during the computation of empowerment is Nn = (NA)n. For each experiment performed, we informally5 determined the minimum time horizon of lookahead necessary to achieve the desired effect. Especially for small simulation steps (such as \u2206 = 0.01), the number n of 1-step actions needed to fill a given time horizon could grow relatively large, which in turn would then lead to a large number of n-step actions, rendering computational costs prohibitive. To reduce the number of n-step actions while still maintaining the same lookahead, each 1-step action in an action sequence was held constant for an extended amount of time, a multiple of the simulation step \u2206. An alternative would be to intelligently compress and prune the lookahead tree, as suggested in (Anthony, Polani, & Nehaniv, 2009) for discrete scenarios, which there allows to extend\n5Note that the metaparameters time horizon, simulation step size (at what frequency the controls are allowed to change), and what amount of noise to add are not independent from each other and must be chosen judiciously and for each domain seperately. If, for example, the variance of the noise is too small relative to the average distance of the successor states (which depends on the horizon), then empowerment will always be close to maximal (the mass of the distributions does not \u201coverlap\u201d and all successor states are treated as distinct). On the other hand, if the noise is too large relative to the average distance of the successor states, then empowerment can no longer distinguish between the effects of different actions (because the individual results are \u201csmeared out\u201c too much). At this time we do not have a full analytical understanding of how the parameters interact and how to best determine them for a given domain in a disciplined way other than by trial and error.\n16\nthe horizon by more than an order of magnitude at similar complexity. Here, however, we are going to demonstrate that even the locally informed empowerment with short lookahead horizons is sufficient to treat aforementioned scenarios.\nResults for inverted pendulum: Figure 5 (top row) shows a phase plot of the behavior that results from starting in the initial condition (pole hanging vertically down) and following 3-step empowerment (and thus Nn = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 n-step actions) for a period of 20 seconds with state transition noise \u03a3 = 0.01I2\u00d72 (where In\u00d7n denotes the n\u00d7n identity matrix). The plot demonstrates that: (1) empowerment alone makes the agent drive up the pendulum and successfully balance it indefinitely; (2) the agent accomplishes the goal without being explicitly \u201ctold\u201d to do so; and (3) the trajectory shows that this happens in a straight and direct way, without wasting time (and consistently so). Note that empowerment only \u201cilluminates\u201d the local potential future of the current state and has no access to the global value of the trajectory as opposed to optimal control methods where implicitly global information about the goal states must be propagated back throughout the system model for the controller to take the right decision.\nTo compare these results with a different angle, we reformulate the problem as a minimum-time optimal control task: as opposed to before, we now assume that the agent has an explicit, externally specified goal (swinging up the pendulum as fast as possible and successfully balancing it afterwards). A step-wise cost function which implements this goal is given by\ng(xt, ut) =\n{\n\u2212\u2016xt\u2016 2 if \u2016xt\u2016 < 0.1 \u22121 otherwise (12)\nSince the dimensionality of the state space is low, we can use dynamic programming (value iteration with grid-based interpolation) to directly determine the optimal behavioral policy, where optimal means choosing actions such that the accumulated costs from Eq. (12) are minimized among all possible behaviors (Sutton & Barto, 1998). Comparing the results in Figure 5 (bottom row) from using dynamic programming as opposed to using the empowerment heuristic in Figure 5 (top row) shows the remarkable result that with empowerment we achieve nearly the same behavior as with optimal control. The result is remarkable because, unlike the optimal value function, which through the underlying cost function is tied to a particular goal, empowerment is a generic heuristic that operates on the innate characteristics of the dynamics of the system alone.\nResults for bicycle: For the more complex bicycle domain, the goal is to keep the bicycle going forward by preventing it from falling over to one side or the other; when the angle from the vertical axis, \u03c9, deviates too much from zero (that is, is greater than 12\u03c0180 ) the bicycle is considered to have fallen. Whenever this happens, the bicycle stops moving forward, and no matter what action the agent takes, the successor state will be the same for all future time steps (absorbing state), and consequently empowerment will be zero.\n17\nHere we examine the behavior of empowerment for different initial conditions of the bicycle: we ran different trials by varying the angle \u03c9 in the interval \u221210\u03c0180 , \u22128\u03c0 180 , . . . , +8\u03c0 180 , +10\u03c0 180 , and \u03c9\u0307 in the interval \u221230\u03c0 180 , \u221225\u03c0 180 , . . . , +25\u03c0 180 , +30\u03c0 180 ; \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0307 were initially zero in all cases. We employ 3-step empowerment (and thus Nn = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 possible n-step actions) where each 1-step action in an action sequence is held constant for 4 simulation steps, and state transition noise \u03a3 = 0.001I4\u00d74. Figure 6 (right) shows that empowerment is able to keep the bicycle stable for a wide range of initial conditions; dots indicate that the bicycle successfully kept going forward for 20 seconds, stars indicate that it did not. Note that in many cases of failure, it would actually have been physically impossible to prevent the bicylce from falling; for example, when the bicycle already is strongly leaning to the left and further has velocity pointing to the left. Also note that the column corresponding to zero angle shows an outlier6; while empowerment was able to balance the bicycle for \u03c9\u0307 = \u221220\u03c0180 , it was not for \u03c9\u0307 = +20\u03c0 180 . Figure 6 (left) shows a phase plot when starting from the initial condition \u03c9 = 8\u03c0180 ; as we can see, empowerment keeps the bicycle stable and brings the system close to the point (0, 0, 0, 0), from where it can be kept stable indefinitely.\nResults for acrobot: For the highly challenging acrobot we require a deeper lookahead: here we consider 5-step empowerment (and thus Nn = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 possible n-step actions), where each 1-step action in an action sequence is held constant for 4 simulation steps, and state transition noise \u03a3 = 0.01I4\u00d74. The phase plot in Figure 8 demonstrates that empowerment then leads to a successful swing-up behavior, approaches the unstable equilibrium, and in particular makes the agent actually balance in the inverted handstand position. Figure 7 illustrates how these numbers translate into the real physical system. Figure 8 (bottom right) shows the corresponding empowerment, that is, it shows for every time step the empowerment value of the state the agent is in; while empowerment does not increase monotonically in every single time step, it increases over the time and reaches the maximum in\n6The outlier is a result of inaccuracy produced from Monte-Carlo approximation. Repeating the experiment with a larger number of samples showed that indeed the bicycle can be balanced from both initial conditions. However, note that these initial conditions were already close to the boundary from where balancing becomes impossible, regardless of how many samples are used.\n18\nthe handstand position. The vertical bar in the figure indicates the point where the \u2019balance\u2019 action was chosen for the first time as the action with highest empowerment. From this point on, just choosing the \u2019balance\u2019 would have been sufficient; however, the phase plot of the control variable reveals that during this phase, the balance action was not always the one with the highest empowerment.7 Note that the \u2019balance\u2019 action (see Eq. (16) in the appendix) produces values in the interval [\u22121,+1] only for states very close to the handstand position and, because of saturation, behaves like the two other actions +1 or \u22121 otherwise."}, {"heading": "5.3 Second scenario: model learning and exploration", "text": "In the second experiment we will discuss a scenarion for empowerment which extends its potential applicability; here we are interested in model learning and using empowerment to extrapolate \u201cintelligently\u201d which part of the state space to explore next.

The agent consists of two components. One is the model learner Mt, which stores a history of all transitions Dt = {xi, ai,x\u2032i} t i=1 seen up to the current time t and which implements multiple GPs to provide 1-step predictions p(xt+1|xt, at,Mt) (Section 4.1) and n-step predictions p(xt+n|xt,~ant ,Mt) (Section 4.2). The second component is the action selector. Given the current state of the environment, we first determine the successor states under each of the possible 1-step actions using the mean8 of the predictions from Mt. For each successor state, we then determine their empowerment value (Section 3.4.3) using n-step predictions from Mt. Since the predicted successor states depend on the accuracy of Mt, we adjust their empowerment scores by the uncertainty of the associated 1-step prediction. This uncertainty is taken to be the sum of the\n7This observation was not due to inaccuracies because of Monte-Carlo approximation. However, while empowerment does not exactly produce the sequence of minimal-time optimal controls, its qualitative behavior is close.\n8Note that, for simplicity, we ignore that the GP-based model learner produces a predictive distribution over successor states and thus naturally incorporates noise/stochasticity of transitions. Computationally it would become quite unwieldy to calculate at every step the expected empowerment value of a successor state, as there is no closed form solution and the integral would have to be evaluated approximately, e.g. again by Monte-Carlo approximation. Note that this simplification did not change our results.\n19\n20\nindividual uncertainties of the state components in Eq. (11). We employ what is called optimism in the face of uncertainty: the less certain the system is, the more we want it to perform an exploratory action. Here, we linearly interpolate between the two extremes maximum uncertainty (where we assign logNn, the upper bound on empowerment) and minimum uncertainty (where we assign the actual empowerment score). The concrete value of the maximum uncertainty, \u03b2 > 0, and minimum uncertainty, \u03b1 \u2265 0, depend on the hyperparameters of the GPs implementing Mt, for details see (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006). At the end, the agent executes the highest ranked action, observes the outcome and updates the model Mt accordingly (for performance reasons only every K steps).

The dynamics of the domain is modified to obtain an episodic learning task: every 500 steps, the state of the system is reset to the initial condition (\u03c0, 0), and a new episode starts. The action selector computes empowerment using the same parameters as in the previous section, with the difference that now 1-step and n-step successor states are predicted by the current model. The model learner is updated (re-trained) every K = 10 samples; for the GPs we employ the ARD kernel (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006) with automatic selection of hyperparameters.\nFor comparison, we consider RMAX (Brafman & Tennenholtz, 2002), a common model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, which also combines exploration, model learning and control, and operates not unlike the learning framework we have described in Section 5.3.1. The main difference is that RMAX is derived from dynamic programming and value iteration and finds agent behavior that optimizes a given performance criterion. The performance criterion, as before, is the explicit cost function Eq. (12), which makes the agent want to reach the goal as fast as possible. For RMAX we have to learn a model both for the transitions of the environment and the cost function. While the former could be done with GPs (same as with empowerment), the latter can not be done by GPs. The reason is that the cost function is flat in every part of the state space except for a very small region about the goal. Since all the initial samples the agent experiences will be from the flat region, a GP would rapidly conclude that the whole cost function is flat; since the uncertainty of the model guides exploration, the GP would predict a \u22121 cost for all states with very high confidence, and thus the agent would miss the goal for a long time (creating a \u201cneedle-in-a-haystack\u201d situation).\nAs it is usually done for RMAX, we therefore use a grid-based discretization to estimate costs and transitions.9 Uncertainty of a prediction then depends on whether or not the underlying grid-cell has been visited before. Since in RMAX unvisited states are more attractive than reaching the goal, the agent tends to explore the environment exhaustively before it can behave optimally.\nIn Figure 10 we compare our empowerment-based exploration with RMAX for various spacings of the underlying grid: we examine division into 25, 50, 75, 100 cells. Every curve shows the cumulative costs (under cost function Eq. (12)) as a function of episode. Thus every curve has two parts: a transient one where the agent is still learning and acting non-optimally, and a steady-state one where the agent is acting optimally with respect to its underlying bias which is either maximizing empowerment or minimization of costs.\nThe graph shows two things: (1) the finer the resolution of the grid, the longer it takes RMAX to act optimally. For a grid of size 25, the agent reaches optimal performance after 23 episodes; for a grid of size 50 it needs 60 episodes; for a grid of size 75 it needs 117 episodes; and for a grid of size 100 it needs 165 episodes. On the other hand, empowerment only needs 3 episodes until steady-state behavior is reached. (2) The steady-state performance of empowerment is somewhat worse than that of RMAX, about 56 versus 78. However, this is not at all surprising. Empowerment does not at all consider the externally defined cost function when making decisions, whereas RMAX specifically optimizes agent behavior such that performance with respect to this particular cost function is maximized. Still, behavior under empowerment is close to what we would achieve by explicitly optimizing a cost function; however,\n9The value iteration part of RMAX is also carried out with interpolation on a high-resolution grid. However, the details of this step are of no concern in this paper, and the performace comparison we make is unaffected by it.\n22\nwith empowerment, the agent can learn this behavior much faster since it does not have to exhaustively explore the state space (it only has to explore the state space to the extent of learning an accurate model for state transitions).\nFigure 11 shows in more detail how empowerment drives the agent to visit only the relevant part of the state space. The figure compares, for empowerment and RMAX with grid spacing 25, what state-action pairs are visited during learning at various points in time (note that in both cases the model learner treats actions independently from each other and does not generalize between them). The plots show that, for the empowerment-based agent, the GP-based model learner can accurately predict state transitions after having seen only few very samples. As the accuracy of predictions goes up, uncertainty of predictions goes down, as the GP becomes more confident about what it does. Low uncertainty in turn means that the agent no longer takes exploratory actions, but instead chooses the one with the highest empowerment. If the learned model is accurate enough, this is as good as knowing the true transitions function and the agent behaves accordingly (compare with model-based results in Section 5.2). As the plot shows, here this happens very soon, right within the first episode. RMAX on the other hand has to exhaustively sample the state-action space and essentially visit every grid-cell under each action. Thus it takes much longer to even reach the goal region and then learn the desired behavior."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "A central question that we need to address is: why does empowerment actually carry out intuitively desirable behaviour? In previous work, it has been shown that this property is not spurious, but actually reappears in a number of disparate scenarios (Klyubin et al., 2005a; Klyubin, Polani, & Nehaniv, 2005b; Klyubin et al., 2008; Anthony, Polani, & Nehaniv, 2008; Anthony et al., 2009).\nOn the other hand, one can clearly create a scenario where empowerment will fail to match the externally imposed goal: imagine for instance the inverted pendulum task, where the target state is\n23\nsome oblique angle \u03c6 6= 0, different from the upright position. Even if the position is sustainable (we remind the reader that the task was underactuated), that position would clearly not match the state an empowerment maximization strategy will try to attain. Nevertheless, the task of placing the pole in an arbitrary oblique position \u03c6 6= 0 strikes one as unnatural if nothing else is specified in the task. In other words, balancing the inverted pendulum seems to be the most unbiased, natural task to do in that scenario.\nHowever, of course, there are scenarios where preferred outcomes do not naturally arise from the system dynamics. The most obvious examples are, e.g., mazes where one needs to reach a particular goal state. This goal state can obviously be arbitrary, and selected independently from the actual dynamics/topology of the system. Even in such scenarios, empowerment still mimics/approximates the graph-theoretic notion of centrality (Anthony et al., 2008); this means that empowerment maximization will place the agent (approximately) at a location in the world from which the expected distance to a randomly specified goal state will be minimal. In other words, it is \u201cthe best guess\u201d where the agent should place itself in expectation of a yet unknown goal, assuming one wishes to minimize the number of steps to the goal10.\n10We completely omit the discussion of the case when different actions have different costs for different states \u2014 this obviously forces one to resort to the full-fledged dynamic programming formalism. However, this is clearly a case where the specification of environmental structure and dynamics are not sufficient for the characterization of the task and the reward structure needs to be explicitly specified. The issues of balancing explicit rewards and the information-theoretic costs of decision making are intricate and are discussed in detail elsewhere (Tishby & Polani, 2010).\n24\nHowever, the performance in our scenarios is even better than that in that the natural goals that one would impose a priori here seem to be anticipated by what empowerment is trying to maximize. Now, all the considered scenarios have one thing in common: they are survival-type scenarios. The agent aims to stay \u201calive\u201d and to move away from \u201cdeath\u201d states as far as possible (we adopt here an argument that is related to Friston\u2019s free energy model of cognition which has been brought up in (Friston, Kilner, & Harrison, 2006; Friston, 2009)).\nWhat makes this particularly interesting in the context of continuous systems which are our point of concern in the present paper is that the smoothness of the system informs the local empowerment gradients around the agent\u2019s state of where the most \u201calive\u201d states are (and many dynamical systems have this property). But even discrete transition graphs display \u2014 in somewhat structured scenarios like grid-worlds or small-world networks (Anthony et al., 2008) \u2014 this property that the attraction basins of global or good local empowerment optima are visible from some distance. This is particularly striking since empowerment seems to correlate well with measures for dominating states in graphs which have been hand-crafted for that purpose (Anthony et al., 2008).\nWhere empowerment maximization coincides with the \u201cnatural\u201d optimal control task, it computes local gradients towards the right direction as opposed to optimal control/dynamic programming which implicitly require a global picture of where the goal states are. It is an open question what properties are required from a system to provide these relatively large attraction basins of empowerment maxima that are visible in local empowerment gradients. This property seems to be present in continuous environments and in environments with some degree of globally homogeneous structures (Anthony et al., 2008).\nDifferent from that are, however, novel degrees of freedom which form \u201cgateways\u201d in the state space in that they are particular locations in the world that grant access to new subregions in the state space (implying novel ways of interacting with the environment) that are otherwise inaccessable from the majority of states. A prime example is the taxi domain from Section 2, where the actions of picking up and dropping off a passenger open new degrees of freedom, but only at specific locations in the maze (another example is the \u201cbox pushing\u201d scenario where an agent\u2019s empowerment increases close to a pushable box due to the increased number of options (Klyubin et al., 2005a)). Such gateways are usually irregular occurences in the state space and will typically only be detected by empowerment if they are in reach of the action horizon. Still, intelligent action sequence extension algorithms such as suggested in (Anthony et al., 2009) may provide recourse and larger effective action horizons even in these cases. However, the examples studied in this paper do not involve any such gateways and all require only relatively short horizons by virtue of their smooth structure. This suggests that for the significant class of dynamic control problems empowerment may provide a purely local exploration and behaviour heuristic which identifies and moves towards particularly \u201cinteresting\u201d areas; the present paper furthermore demonstrates how this can be implemented in an efficient on-line fashion."}, {"heading": "7 Summary", "text": "This paper has discussed empowerment, an information-theoretic quantity that measures, for any agentenvironment system with stochastic transitions, the extent to which the agent can influence the environment by its actions. While earlier work with empowerment has already shown its various uses in a number of different domains, empowerment calculation was previously limited to the case of small-scale and discrete domains where state transition probabilities were assumed to be known by the agent. The main contribution of this paper is to relax both assumptions. First, this paper extends calculation of empowerment to the case of continuous vector-valued state spaces. Second, we discuss an application of empowerment to exploration and online model learning where we no longer assume that the precise state transition probabilities are a priori known to the agent. Instead, the agent has to learn them through interacting with the environment.\n25\nBy addressing vector-valued state spaces and model learning, this paper already significantly advances the applicability of empowerment to real-world scenarios. Still, from a computational point of view, open questions remain. One question in particular is how to best deal with continuous, vectorvalued action spaces \u2013 so far we assumed in this paper that the action space could be discretized.

Thus, to keep the bicycle going forward, the bicycle has to be prevented from falling.\nThe solution to the continuous-time dynamic equations in Eqs. (17)-(18) is obained using a RungeKutta solver. The time step of the simulation is 0.2 sec, during which the applied control is kept constant. The 4-dimensional state vector is x(t) = ( \u03c9(t), \u03c9\u0307(t), \u03b1(t), \u03b1\u0307(t) )T , the 2-dimensional control vector is u(t) = ( \u03b4(t), u(t) )T\n. Control variable \u03b4 was allowed to vary in [\u22120.02, 0.02], \u03b1 was allowed to vary in [\u22122, 2]. Since our algorithm in Section 3.4.3 allows us to compute empowerment only for a finite set of possible 1-step actions, we discretized the continuous control space. As in (Lagoudakis & Parr, 2003), we only consider the following 5 discrete actions: a1 = (\u22120.02, 0), a2 = (0, 0), a3 = (0.02, 0), a4 = (0,\u22122), a5 = (0, 2).\n28"}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2012, "abstractText": "This paper develops generalizations of empowerment to continuous states. Empowerment is a recently introduced information-theoretic quantity motivated by hypotheses about the efficiency of the sensorimotor loop in biological organisms, but also from considerations stemming from curiositydriven learning. Empowemerment measures, for agent-environment systems with stochastic transitions, how much influence an agent has on its environment, but only that influence that can be sensed by the agent sensors. It is an information-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on environment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by the agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in control theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces. Earlier work has shown that empowerment has various interesting and relevant properties, e.g., it allows us to identify salient states using only the dynamics, and it can act as intrinsic reward without requiring an external reward. However, in this previous work empowerment was limited to the case of small-scale and discrete domains and furthermore state transition probabilities were assumed to be known. The goal of this paper is to extend empowerment to the significantly more important and relevant case of continuous vector-valued state spaces and initially unknown state transition probabilities. The continuous state space is addressed by Monte-Carlo approximation; the unknown transitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply Gaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting. In a number of well-known continuous control tasks we examine the dynamics induced by empowerment and include an application to exploration and online model learning.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
