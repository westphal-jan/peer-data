While supporting model specifications at an abstract, first-order logic level, inference is typically performed at the level of concrete ground instances of the models, i.e., at the propositional level. This mismatch between model specification and inference methods has been noted early on (Jaeger 1997), and has given rise to numerous proposals for inference techniques that operate at the high level of the underlying model specifications (Poole 2003; de Salvo Braz et al. 2005; Milch et al. 2008; Kisyn\u0301ski and Poole 2009; Jha et al. 2010; Gogate and Domingos 2011; Van den Broeck et al. 2011; Van den Broeck 2011; Fierens et al. 2011). Inference methods of this nature have collectively become known as \u201clifted\u201d inference techniques.\nThe concept of lifted inference is mostly introduced on an informal level: \u201c...lifted,\nthat is, deals with groups of random variables at a first-order level\u201d (de Salvo Braz et al. 2005); \u201cThe act of exploiting the high level structure in relational models is called lifted inference\u201d (Apsel and Brafman 2011); \u201cThe idea behind lifted inference is to carry out as much inference as possible without propositionalizing (Kisyn\u0301ski and Poole 2009); \u201clifted inference, which deals with groups of indistinguishable variables, rather than individual ground atoms (Singla et al. 2010). While, thus, the term lifted inference emerges as a quite coherent algorithmic metaphor, it is not immediately obvious what its exact technical meaning should be. Since quite a variety of different algorithmic approaches are collected under the label \u201clifted\u201d, and since most of them can degenerate for certain models to ground, or propositional, inference, it is difficult to precisely define the class of lifted inference techniques in terms of specific algorithmic techniques employed.\nA more fruitful approach is to make more precise the concept of lifted inference in terms of its objectives. Here one observes that lifted inference techniques very consistently are evaluated on, and compared against each other, by how well inference complexity scales as a function of the domain (or population) for which the general model is instantiated. Thus, empirical evaluations of lifted inference techniques are usually presented in the form of domainsize vs. inference time plots as shown in Figure 1.\nVan den Broeck (2011), therefore, has proposed a formal definition of domain lifted inference in terms of polynomial time complexity in the domainsize parameter. Experimental and theoretical analyses of existing lifted inference techniques then show that they provide domain lifted inference in some cases where basic propositional inference techniques would exhibit exponential complexity (as illustrated in Figure 1). However, until recently, these positive results were mostly limited to examples of individual models, and little was known about the feasibility of lifted inference for certain well-defined classes of models. First results that show the feasibility of lifted inference for whole classes of models are given by Van den Broeck (2011), and Domingos and Webb (2012).\nOn the other hand, (Jaeger 2000) has shown that under certain assumptions on the expressivity of the modeling language, probabilistic inference is not polyno-\nmial in the domainsize, thereby demonstrating some inherent limitations in terms of worst-case complexity for the goals of lifted inference. However, the results of (Jaeger 2000) are based on types of probabilistic logic models that are somewhat different from the models that presently receive the most attention: first, they essentially assume a directed modeling framework, in which the model represents a generative stochastic process for sampling relational structures. The model is defined by specifying marginal and conditional probability distributions for random variables corresponding to ground atoms. Ground instances of the model, then, can be represented by directed graphical models, i.e., Bayesian networks. While the majority of existing model classes fall into the category of directed models (Breese 1992; Poole 1993; Sato 1995; Ngo et al. 1995; Jaeger 1997; Friedman et al. 1999; Kersting and Raedt 2001; Milch et al. 2005; Vennekens et al. 2006), there is currently a lot of interest in undirected models that are given by a set of soft constraints on relational structures, specified in the form of potential functions, and in the ground case giving rise to undirected graphical models, i.e., Markov networks. Secondly, the results of (Jaeger 2000) require quite strong assumptions on the expressivity of the probabilistic-logic modeling language, which is required to allow that conditional distributions of atoms can be specified dependent on unrestricted first-order properties. Much current work, in contrast, is concerned with languages that only incorporate certain weak fragments of first-order logic.\nIn this paper the general approach of (Jaeger 2000) is extended to obtain lower complexity bounds for inference in probabilistic-logic model classes that have emerged as the focus of interest for lifted inference techniques, i.e., undirected models based on quantifier- and function-free fragments of first-order logic.\nIn a sharp contrast with (Jaeger 2000), where a \u201ctrivial\u201d constant-time approximate inference method was described, we show that our lower complexity bounds also hold for approximate inference. Further sharpening earlier results, we finally establish that the lower complexity bounds also hold for models not using the equality predicate, which in (Jaeger 2000) was conjectured to be the key source of inherent complexity.\nA preliminary version of this paper has been published as (Jaeger 2012). Its main\nresults were also already included in the survey paper (Jaeger and Van den Broeck 2012), which contains a systematic overview of known results and open problems related to the complexity of lifted inference.\nIn the following section we introduce a general framework in which classes of undirected probabilistic-logic models, and classes of associated inference problems can be defined. Section 3 reviews classic results relating first-order logic models to the complexity class NETIME. Section 4 contains our main results, and Section 5 discusses some notable differences that emerge between the results for directed and for undirected models."}, {"heading": "2 Weighted Feature Models", "text": "Similarly as (Richardson and Domingos 2006), (Van den Broeck et al. 2011) and (Gogate and Domingos 2011) we assume the following framework: a model, or knowl-\nedge base, is given by a set of weighted formulas:\nKB :\n\u03c61(v1) : w1 \u03c62(v2) : w2 . . . . . . \u03c6n(vN ) : wN\n(1)\nwhere the \u03c6i are formulas in first-order predicate logic, wi \u2208 R are non-negative weights, and vi = (vi,1, . . . , vi,ki) are the free variables of \u03c6i. The case ki = 0, i.e., \u03c6i is a sentence without free variables, is also permitted. The \u03c6i use a given signature S of relation-, function-, and constant symbols.\nAn interpretation (or possible world) (D, I) for S consists of a domain D, and an interpretation function I that maps the symbols in S to functions, relations and elements on D. For a tuple d \u2208 Dki then the truth value of \u03c6i(vi/d) is defined, and we write (D, I) |= \u03c6i(d), or simpler I |= \u03c6i(d), if \u03c6i(/ vi/d) is true in (D, I). We use I(D,S) to denote the set of all interpretations for the signature S over the domain D.\nIn this paper we are only concerned with finite domains, and assume without loss\nof generality that D = Dn := {1, . . . , n} for some n \u2208 N.\nFor I \u2208 I(Dn, S) let #(i, I) denote the number of elements d in Dki for which\nI |= \u03c6i(d). The weight of I then is\nWKB,n(I) :=\nN\u220f\ni=1\nw #(i,I) i , (2)\nwhere 00 = 1. The probability of I is\nPKB,n(I) = WKB,n(I)/Z\nwhere Z is the normalizing constant (partition function)\nZ = \u2211\nI\u2208I(Dn,S)\nWKB,n(I). (3)\nFor a first-order sentence \u03c6 and n \u2208 N then\nPKB,n(\u03c6) := PKB,n({I \u2208 I(Dn, S) | I |= \u03c6}) (4)\nis the probability of \u03c6 in I(Dn, S).\nWe call a knowledge base (1) together with the semantics given by (2) and (4) a weighted feature model, since it associates weights wi with model features \u03c6i. Weighted feature models in our sense can be seen as a slight generalization as weighted model counting (wmc) frameworks (Fierens et al. 2011; Gogate and Domingos 2011) in which non-zero weights are only associated with literals. Knowledge bases of the form (1) can be translated into wmc frameworks via an introduction of new relation symbols R1, . . . , Rn, hard constraints \u03c6i(vi) \u2194 Ri(vi), and weighted formulas Ri(vi) : wi (Van den Broeck et al. 2011; Gogate and Domingos 2011). Up to an expansion of the signature, thus, weighted feature models and wmc are equally expressive. Markov Logic Networks (Richardson and Domingos 2006) also are based on knowledge bases of the form (1) allowing arbitrary formulas \u03c6i. However, the\nsemantics of the model there depends on a transformation of the formulas into conjunctive normal form, and therefore does not exactly correspond to (2) and (4), unless the \u03c6i are clauses.\nAll types of models here discussed, thus, are very similar in nature, and only differ with respect to certain restrictions on what types of logically defined features can be associated with a weight. The general definition of weighted feature models gives us the flexibility of considering a variety of classes of such restrictions.\nA probabilistic inference problem PI(KB, n, \u03c7, \u03b7) for a weighted feature model is given by a knowledge base KB, a domainsize n \u2208 N, and two first-order sentences \u03c7, \u03b7. The solution to the inference problem is the conditional probability PKB,n(\u03c7 | \u03b7).\nA class of inference problems is defined by allowing arguments KB, \u03c7, and \u03b7 only from some restricted classes KB, Q (the query class), and E (the evidence class), respectively. We use the notation\nPI(KB,Q, E) := {PI(KB, n, \u03c6, \u03c8) | KB \u2208 KB, n \u2208 N, \u03c7 \u2208 Q, \u03b7 \u2208 E}\nfor classes of inference problems.\nThe results of this paper will be given for the case where Q consists of all ground atoms, denoted AT , and E is empty. Thus, as far as Q and E are concerned, we are considering the most restrictive class of inference problems. Since we are deriving lower complexity bounds, this leads to the strongest possible results, which directly apply also to more general classes Q and E .\nClasses KB are defined by various syntactic restrictions on the formulas \u03c6i in the knowledge base. In this paper, we consider the following fragments of firstorder logic (FOL): relational FOL (RFOL), i.e. FOL without function and constant symbols; 0-RFOL, which is the quantifier-free fragment of RFOL, and 0-RFOL 6=, which is 0-RFOL without the equality relation.\nAn algorithm solves a class PI(KB,Q, E), if it solves all instances PI(KB, n, \u03c7, \u03b7) in the class. An algorithm \u01eb-approximately solves PI(KB,Q, E), if for any PI(KB, n, \u03c7, \u03b7) in the class it returns a number p \u2208 [PKB,n(\u03c7 | \u03b7) \u2212 \u01eb, PKB,n(\u03c7 | \u03b7) + \u01eb]. An algorithm that solves PI(KB,Q, E) is polynomial in the domainsize, if for fixed KB, \u03c7, \u03b7 the computation of PI(KB, n, \u03c7, \u03b7) is polynomial in n."}, {"heading": "3 Spectra and Complexity", "text": "The following definition introduces the central concept for our analysis.\nDefinition 3.1 Let \u03c6 be a sentence in first-order logic. The spectrum of \u03c6 is the set of integers n \u2208 N for which \u03c6 is satisfiable by an interpretation of size n.\nExample 3.2 Let \u03c6 = \u03c81 \u2227 \u03c82 \u2227 \u03c83, where\n\u03c81 \u2261 \u2200x, y u(x, y) \u21d4 u(y, x) \u03c82 \u2261 \u2200x \u2203y y 6= x \u2227 u(x, y) \u03c83 \u2261 \u2200x, y, y\u2032 (u(x, y) \u2227 u(x, y\u2032) \u21d2 y = y\u2032)\n\u03c6 expresses that the binary relation u defines an undirected graph (\u03c81) in which every node is connected to exactly one other node (\u03c82, \u03c83). Thus, \u03c6 describes a pairing relation that is satisfiable exactly over domains of even size: spec(\u03c6) = {n | n even}.\nThe complexity class ETIME consists of problems solvable in time O(2cn), for some constant c. The corresponding nondeterministic class is NETIME. Note that these classes are distinct from the more commonly studied classes (N)EXPTIME, which are characterized by complexity bounds O(2n c ) (Johnson 1990). For n \u2208 N let bin(n) \u2208 {0, 1}\u2217 denote the binary coding of n, and un(n) \u2208 {1}\u2217 the unary coding (i.e., n is represented as a sequence of n 1s). A set S \u2286 N is in (N)ETIME, iff {bin(n) | n \u2208 S} is in (N)ETIME, which also is equivalent to {un(n) | n \u2208 S} being in (N)PTIME.\nLike (Jaeger 2000), we use the following connection between spectra and NETIME\nas the key tool for our complexity analysis.\nTheorem 3.3 (Jones and Selman 1972) A set A \u2286 N is in NETIME, iff A is the spectrum of a sentence \u03c6 \u2208 RFOL.\nCorollary 3.4 If NETIME 6= ETIME, then there exists a first-order sentence \u03c6, such that {un(n) | n \u2208 spec(\u03c6)} is not recognized in deterministic polynomial time.\nThus, by reducing instances n \u2208 spec(\u03c6)? of the spectrum recognition problem to probabilistic inference problems PI(KB, n, \u03c7, \u03b7), where KB \u2208 KB, \u03c7 \u2208 Q, \u03b7 \u2208 E are fixed for the given \u03c6, one establishes that the PI(KB,Q, E) is not polynomial in the domainsize (under the assumption ETIME 6= NETIME)."}, {"heading": "4 Complexity Results", "text": "This section contains our complexity results. We begin with a result for knowledge bases using full RFOL. This is rather straightforward, and (for exact inference) already implied by the results of (Jaeger 2000). We then proceed to extend this base result to 0-RFOL and 0-RFOL 6=."}, {"heading": "4.1 Base Result: the RFOL Case", "text": "Theorem 4.1 If NETIME 6= ETIME, then there does not exist an algorithm that 0.25-approximately solves PI(RFOL,AT , \u2205) in time polynomial in the domainsize.\nThe proof of this theorem provides the general pattern also for subsequent proofs.\nIt is therefore here given in full. Proof: Let \u03c6 be a sentence with a non-polynomial spectrum as given by Corollary 3.4. Let S be the relational signature of \u03c6. Let a() be a new relation symbol of\narity zero (i.e., a() represents a propositional variable). The first weighted formula in our knowledge base then is\n\u00ac(\u03c6 \u2194 a()) : 0 (5)\nWe now already have that PKB,n(a()) > 0 iff there exists I \u2208 I(Dn, S) with I |= \u03c6, i.e., iff n \u2208 spec(\u03c6). This already reduces the decision problem for spec(\u03c6) to solving PI(KB, n, a(), \u2205) exactly. However, from the 0-1 laws of first-order logic (Fagin 1976), it follows that for our current KB : PKB,n(a()) \u2192n\u2192\u221e 0. Thus, for every \u01eb > 0 we could define an \u01eb-approximate constant-time inference algorithm by returning 0 for all sufficiently large n.\nIn order to obtain our result for approximate inference, we will now ensure that for all n \u2208 spec(\u03c6) the probability PKB,n(a()) is greater than 0.5, while it remains zero for n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6). We do this essentially by calibrating the normalization constant Z in (3). For this we introduce another new relation b(), and add to KB :\n\u00ac(( \u2227\nR\u2208S\n\u2200x\u00acR(x)) \u2194 b()) : 0 (6)\nThus, for every n there is exactly one interpretation I \u2208 I(Dn, S) with nonzero weight in which b() is true (the one in which all relations have empty interpretations). Finally, we give zero weight to all interpretations except those in which a() or b() is true:\n\u00ac(a() \u2228 b()) : 0 (7)\nLet KB consist of (5),(6),(7). Every I \u2208 I(Dn, S) then has weight 0 if it satisfies one of the three formulas, and weight 1 otherwise. Consider the case n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6). Then, by (5) WKB,n(a()) = 0. By (7) this then means that in all interpretations of nonzero weight b() must be true. By (6) there is exactly one such interpretation. Thus, Z in (3) is 1, and PKB,n(a()) = 0/1 = 0.\nIf n \u2208 spec(\u03c6), then WKB,n(a()) \u2265 1, and Z = WKB,n(a()) (if the interpretation in which all R are empty also is a model of \u03c6), or Z = WKB,n(a()) + 1 (otherwise). Thus, PKB,n(a()) \u2265 1/2. A 0.25-approximate inference algorithm for PI(KB, n, a(), \u2205), thus, would decide spec(\u03c6)."}, {"heading": "4.2 The 0-RFOL Case", "text": "We now proceed towards our main result, which is going from RFOL to 0-RFOL. If we wanted to allow function and constant symbols in our knowledge base, then one could go to a quantifier-free fragment in a quite straightforward manner using Skolemization. Since satisfiability over a given domain is the same for a formula \u03c6 and its quantifier-free Skolemized version \u03c6Skol, the arguments of the proof of Theorem 4.1 would go through with little change. In order to accomplish the same using only the relational fragment 0-RFOL, we define the relational Skolemization of a formula. The idea is to replace function and constant symbols in the Skolemized version of a formula with relational representations. For example, the Skolemized\nversion of \u03c82 from Example 3.2 is\n\u03c8Skol2 \u2261 \u2200x f(x) 6= x \u2227 u(x, f(x))\nwith a new function symbol f(). Introducing a relational encoding of f() leads to\n\u03c8R-Skol2 \u2261 \u2200x, y R f (x, y) \u2192 (y 6= x \u2227 u(x, y))\nwith Rf a new binary relation symbol encoding f(). This translation must be accompanied by axioms that confine the possible interpretations of Rf to relations that encode functions.\nSuch relational encodings of functions are well established. However, there does not seem to be a standard account of this technique that serves our purpose. The following proposition, therefore, provides the relevant result in a form tailored for our needs.\nProposition 4.2 Let \u03c6(x) \u2208 0-FOL(S \u222a SF ), where S is a set of relation symbols, and SF a set of function and constant symbols. Let S+ be a set of new relation symbols that for every k-ary f \u2208 SF contains a k+1-ary Rf (constant symbols are treated as 0-ary function symbols). Let Func be the set of sentences that for every f \u2208 SF contains\n\u2200x y y\u2032 (Rf (x, y) \u2227Rf(x, y\u2032) \u2192 y = y\u2032) (8)\n\u2200x\u2203y Rf (x, y). (9)\nThen there exists a formula \u03c6+(x, z) \u22080-RFOL(S \u222a S+), such that the following are equivalent for all n:\ni there exists I \u2208 I(Dn, S \u222a SF ) with I |= \u2200x\u03c6(x) ii there exists I+ \u2208 I(Dn, S \u222a S+) with I+ |= Func \u2227 \u2200xz \u03c6+(x, z)\nIf \u03c6Skol is the Skolemization of a formula \u03c6 \u2208RFOL, we then call \u03c6Skol + the\nrelational Skolemization of \u03c6, written \u03c6R-Skol.\nOur plan, now, is to prove the analogon of Theorem 4.1 for 0-RFOL by replacing \u03c6 in (5) with \u03c6R-Skol. However, this is not enough, since we also need to constrain the models of our knowledge base (more precisely: those models in which a() is true) to satisfy the axioms (8) and (9). This poses a problem, because (9) contains an existential quantifier, and so we cannot add this axiom directly as a constraint to a knowledge base restricted to 0-RFOL. Indeed, we almost seem to have gone full circle, since we are back at knowledge bases in a relational vocabulary with existential quantification! However, we now have reduced arbitrary occurrences of existential quantifiers to occurrences only within in the special formulas (9).\nOur strategy, now, is to approximate formulas (9) with weighted formulas of the\nform\na() \u2227Rf(x, y) : w (10)\nthat reward models of a() in which the existential quantifier of (9) is satisfied for many (all) x. We will no longer be able to ensure that WKB,n(a()) = 0 when n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6). However, by a suitable choice of w, and by a careful calibration of the weight of models of the alternative proposition b(), we still can ensure that\nWKB,n(b()) \u226b WKB,n(a()) when n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6), and WKB,n(b()) \u2248 WKB,n(a()) when n \u2208 spec(\u03c6). However, the right calibration of the weights of models of a() and b() within I(Dn, S) will now require that one sets w to a value w(n) depending on n.\nThis means that we no longer can reduce the decision problem n \u2208 spec(\u03c6) to the probabilistic inference problem PI(KB, n, a(), \u2205) for a fixed knowledge base KB. We only achieve a reduction to the inference problem PI(KB(w(n)), n, a(), \u2205), where the logical structure of KB is fixed, but a weight parameter w(n) depends on n. Generally, for a knowledge base KB containing N weighted formulas, we denote with KB(w1, . . . , wN ) the knowledge base that contains the same formulas as KB, but with the weights set to values w1, . . . , wN .\nTo translate the lower complexity bounds of the original spectrum recognition problem into lower complexity bounds for the resulting inference problem, one now has to be precise about the representation of the inference problem. To this end, we assume that weights w are rational numbers, and represented by pairs (u, v) of integers, so that w = u/v. We then define the representation size l(w) as log(| u | +1) + log(| v | +1). The total representation size of the weight parameters w = (w1, . . . , wN ) in a knowledge base is l(w) := \u2211N i=1 l(wi). An inference algorithm for probabilistic inference problems in PI(KB,Q, E) is polynomial in the domainsize and the representation size of the weight parameters, if for any KB \u2208 KB, \u03c7 \u2208 Q, \u03b7 \u2208 E the class of inference problems PI(KB(w), n, \u03c7, \u03b7) can be solved in time that is bounded by a polynomial \u2211d\ni,j=0 \u03b1i,j l(w) inj (\u03b1i,j \u2208 R, d \u2208 N ). We can now\nstate the following theorem:\nTheorem 4.3 If NETIME 6= ETIME, then there does not exist an algorithm that 0.2-approximately solves PI(0-RFOL,AT , \u2205) in time polynomial in the domainsize and the representation size of the weight parameters.\nThe full proof of the theorem is given in the appendix. It consists of a polynomialtime reduction of the n \u2208 spec(\u03c6) decision problem to a probabilistic inference problem PI(KB(w(n)), n, a(), \u2205), where l(w(n)) is polynomial in n. An inference algorithm that can solve PI(KB(w(n)), n, a(), \u2205) in time polynomial in the domainsize and l(w(n)), thus, would yield a polynomial decision procedure for spec(\u03c6).\n4.3 Polynomiality in l(w)\nOne may wonder how strong or surprising Theorem 4.3 really is in light of its extra runtime polynomial in l(w) condition. It has previously been emphasized that lifted inference procedures should only be expected to be polynomial in the domain size, but not in other parameters that characterize the complexity of KB (Jaeger 2000; Van den Broeck 2011). These remarks, however, have mostly been motivated by considerations of the logical complexity of KB, e.g. in terms of the number and complexity of its weighted formulas, or the size of the signature. The complexity in terms of numerical parameters, on the other hand, has not received much attention.\nTo better understand the nature of the condition of being polynomial in the domainsize and l(w), we have to look a little closer at how the parameters affect\nthe complexity of the computation. We consider algorithms that can be described as follows: to compute PI(KB(w), n, \u03c7, \u03b7) the algorithm performs a number of steps i = 1, . . . , L, where step i consists either of executing a constant time operation that does not depend on the numerical model parameters (e.g., a logical operation on formulas), or of a basic operation on numerical parameters.\nWe consider the executions the algorithm performs on inputs with fixed logical structure KB, and fixed \u03c7, \u03b7, but varying weight parameters w and domainsizes n. Let Vw,n(i) denote the set of all numerical variables stored by the algorithm before performing step i, when it is run on inputs (w, n). Thus, Vw,n(i) comprises the original weight parameters of the model, as well as computed intermediate results, etc. We now make two basic assumptions on the algorithm:\n(A1) The weight parameters w only influence the numerical values of the variables\nstored in Vw,n(i), but not the sequence of execution steps performed by the algorithm. In particular, the number of execution steps performed by the algorithm only depends on n: L = L(n).\n(A2) The basic operations performed on numerical variables are polynomial time\nin the size of their arguments, and they produce an output whose size is linear in the size of the inputs. This is the case for the basic arithmetic operations addition and multiplication, for example.\nThe total representation size of Vw,n(i) then is bounded by cn(i)l(w), where cn(i) is a coefficient not depending on w. Also, let q() be a polynomial that provides a common complexity bound for the basic numerical operations that can be performed at one step. The total execution time of the algorithm on input (w, n) then is bounded by\nL(n)\u2211\ni=1\nq(cn(i)l(w)). (11)\nIf, now, for fixed weight vectors w the algorithm is polynomial in n (equivalently: the algorithm is polynomial in n under a computation model where basic numeric operations are constant time), then L(n) and maxi=1,...,L(n) cn(i) must be polynomially bounded in n. The combined complexity (11) then, in fact, is polynomial both in n and l(w).\nIn summary, this shows: an algorithm that for fixedw is polynomial in n, and that satisfies assumptions (A1) and (A2), actually is polynomial in n and l(w). Thus, for this type of algorithm, the additional restriction of Theorem 4.3 compared to Theorem 4.1 is insignificant.\nThe remaining question, then, is how restrictive or realistic assumptions (A1) and (A2) actually are. For exact inference algorithms it appears that (A1) and (A2) are satisfied by all existing approaches, with a small qualification: algorithms might give special treatment to special weight parameters, such as w = 0 or w = \u221e, which then can lead to a violation of (A1) in the strict sense. However, our analysis could also be performed based on a weakened form of (A1) that allows certain special weights to influence the computation differently from proper numerical weights\n0 < w < \u221e. A slightly more elaborate argument would then arrive at essentially the same conclusions.\nThe situation is less clear for approximate inference algorithms. Here the numerical values stored in Vw,n(i) may influence the algorithm in multiple ways: for example, they can be used to test a termination condition, or to decided which computations to perform next in order to improve approximation bounds derived so far. In all such cases, the model weights w can have an impact on the sequence and the total number of execution steps, and (A1) is not satisfied. Thus, even though the theorem also applies to approximate inference, its implications for the construction of approximate inference algorithms may be less severe, since there might be reasonable ways to build approximate inference algorithms that are polynomial in n, without also being polynomial in l(w)."}, {"heading": "4.4 The 0-RFOL 6= Case", "text": "In a final strengthening of our results, we now move on to the fragment 0-RFOL6=. The availability of the equality predicate for the formulas of KB, so far, has been an important prerequisite for our arguments, because Theorem 3.3 crucially depends on equality: spectra for formulas \u03c6 \u2208 RFOL6= are always of the form N \\ {1, . . . , k} for some k, and, thus, decidable in constant time. For this reason it was suggested in (Jaeger 2000) that one should focus on logical fragments without equality when looking for model classes for which lifted inference scales polynomially in the domainsize. As our final result shows, however, elimination of equality may not have such a large impact on complexity, after all.\nTheorem 4.4\nIf NETIME 6= ETIME, then there does not exist an algorithm that 0.2-approximately solves PI(0-RFOL6=,AT , \u2205) in time polynomial both in the domainsize, and the representation size of the weight parameters.\nThis theorem is a generalization of Theorem 4.3, and, strictly speaking, makes 4.3 redundant. It is only for expository purposes, and greater transparency in the proof arguments, that we here develop these results in two steps.\nThe proof of Theorem 4.4 is a refinement of the proof of Theorem 4.3. In addition to approximating Skolem functions f with relations Rf , we now also approximate the equality predicate = with a binary relation E(\u00b7, \u00b7). Similarly as we could not impose in 0-RFOL hard constraints that ensure that Rf encodes a function, we also cannot constrain models to always interpret E as the equality relation. However, just as with (8) and (10) we rewarded interpretations with functional Rf , we can penalize interpretations in which E is not true equality by means of the two weighted formulas\na() \u2227 \u00acE(x, x) : 0 (12)\na() \u2227 E(x, y) : 1/w (13)\nwhere w is a large weight."}, {"heading": "5 Approximate Inference , Convergence, and Evidence", "text": "There are some notable differences with respect to approximate inference between the results we here obtained for weighted model counting, and the results of (Jaeger 2000). In (Jaeger 2000) it was shown that due to convergence of query probabilities Pn(a()) as n \u2192 \u221e, in theory a trivial constant time approximation algorithm exists: perform exact inference for all input domains up to a size n\u2217, and output the limit probability for all domains of size > n\u2217. This \u201calgorithm\u201d, however, has no practical use, since for a desired accuracy value \u01eb one first would have to determine a sufficiently high threshold value n\u2217 \u2208 N to make the output indeed be an \u01eb-approximation.\nNevertheless, the difference between the existence of an impractical approximation algorithm on the one hand, and the non-existence of any approximation algorithm on the other hand, is just one consequence of a more fundamental difference: while in the models considered in (Jaeger 2000) query probabilities Pn(a()) converge to a limit, this is not necessarily the case for knowledge bases of weighted formulas \u2013 at least when full RFOL is allowed: in the proof of Theorem 4.1 we have constructed knowledge bases KB, such that PKB,n(a()) oscillates between zero and values > 1/2 as n oscillates between spec(\u03c6) and its complement. The construction of knowledge bases with this behavior does not require formulas \u03c6 with a non-polynomial spectrum as in Corollary 3.4, and is not contingent on NETIME 6= ETIME. Already a knowledge base as constructed in the proof of Theorem 4.1 with \u03c6 replaced by \u03c8 of Example 3.2 will show this behavior.\nThe reason behind these different convergence properties lies in a somewhat different role that conditioning on evidence plays in directed and undirected models: in the former, a conditional probability PM,n(a() | b()) defined by a model M can, in general, not be defined as an unconditional probability PM \u2032,n(a()) in a modified model M \u2032. As a result, the convergence guarantees and \u2013 theoretical \u2013 approximability for certain classes of unconditional queries PM,n(a()), do not carry over to conditional queries PM,n(a() | b()).\nFor weighted feature knowledge bases KB, on the other hand, there is no fundamental difference between unconditional and conditional queries PKB\u2032,n(a()) and PKB,n(a() | b()), respectively. To reduce the conditional to unconditional queries, one can just add to KB the hard constraint \u00acb() : 0 to obtain KB\u2032 with PPKB\u2032,n = PKB,n | b(). This means that as long as E is not more expressive than KB, the problem classes PI(KB,Q, E) and PI(KB,Q, \u2205) have the same characteristics in terms of complexity as a function of the domainsize. Note, though, that this is only true when we consider complexity of PI(KB, n, \u03c7, \u03b7) strictly as a function of n for fixed KB, \u03c7, \u03b7. If the evidence is allowed to change with the domainsize, i.e., \u03b7 = \u03b7(n), then even in cases where restrictions on KB make PI(KB,Q, E) polynomial in n, one can define sequences of inference problems PI(KB, n, \u03c7, \u03b7(n)) with KB \u2208 KB, \u03b7(n) \u2208 E that are no longer polynomial in n (Van den Broeck and Davis 2012)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We have shown that for currently quite popular probabilistic-logic models consisting of collections of weighted, quantifier- and function-free formulas there is likely to be no general polynomial lifted inference method (contingent on NETIME 6= ETIME). Somewhat surprisingly, this even holds for approximate inference. Between this negative result, and the positive result of (Van den Broeck 2011), there still could be a lot of room for identifying tractable fragments by restricting 0-RFOL further via limits on the number of variables, or the richness of the signature S."}, {"heading": "Appendix A Proofs", "text": "Proof of Proposition 4.2:\nWe begin by defining the term-depth of a term t in the signature SF as the maximal nesting depth of function symbols in t. Precisely, we define inductively: if t \u2261 x, then t has term depth 0. If t \u2261 f() (a constant), or t = f(x1, . . . , xk) (a function term with only variables as arguments), then t has term depth 1. If t = f(t1, . . . , tk), then the term depth of t is one plus the maximal term depth of the ti.\nThe term depth of a formula \u03c6(x) is the maximal term depth of the terms it\ncontains.\nWe now show that every formula \u03c6(x) of term depth l can be transformed into a formula \u03c6l\u22121(x, z) of term depth l \u2212 1 in 0-FOL(S \u222a SF \u222a S+), such that the statement for \u03c6+ of the proposition holds for \u03c6l\u22121 (but with S\u222aSF \u222aS+ instead of S\u222aS+ in ii). The proposition then follows by defining \u03c6+ as the result of iteratively applying l such transformations to \u03c6. Since the term depth of the resulting \u03c6+ is zero, then actually \u03c6+(x, z) \u22080-RFOL(S \u222a S+).\nLet {fi(xi) | i = 1, . . . , r} be the set of all distinct terms (including sub-terms) of depth 1 appearing in \u03c6(x). Let z1, . . . , zr be new variables. Define \u03c6 l\u22121(x, z) as\nr\u2227\ni=1\nRfi(xi, zi) \u2192 \u03c6(x)[z1/f1(x1), . . . , zr/fr(xr)]\nTo now show i\u21d2ii let I \u2208 I(n, S\u222aSF ) with I |= \u2200x\u03c6(x). Define I+ \u2208 I(n, S\u222aSF\u222a S+) as the expansion of I in which each Rf \u2208 S+ is interpreted as the relational representation of f , i.e., I+ |= Rf (d, e) iff I |= f(d) = e. Clearly, I+ |= Func. Furthermore, the following are equivalent:\nI |= \u2200x\u03c6(x) I |= \u2200xz \u2227r\ni=1 fi(xi) = zi \u2192 \u03c6(x)[z1/f1(x1), . . . , zr/fr(xr)]\nI+ |= \u2200xz \u2227r\ni=1 R fi(xi, zi)\n\u2192 \u03c6(x)[z1/f1(x1), . . . , zr/fr(xr)]\nFor ii\u21d2i let I+ as in ii be given. Since I+ |= Func, we can turn I+ into an interpretation for S\u222aSF by defining f(d) as the unique e for which Rf(d, e) holds in I+. Then, by the same equivalences as above, I+ |= \u2200xz \u03c6+(x, z) implies I |= \u2200x\u03c6(x).\nProof of Theorem 4.3: Let \u03c6 \u2208RFOL as given by Corollary 3.4, and \u2200x \u03c6R-Skol(x) its relational Skolemization. Let S be the original signature of \u03c6, and S+ the relation symbols introduced in the relational Skolemization. Furthermore, for each k-ary R+ \u2208 S+ we introduce a new (k\u2212 1)-ary relation R++. These new symbols will be used to calibrate the weight of models for the reference proposition b(). Note that the arity of symbols in S+ is at least 1, and R++, thus, is well-defined, but may contain relations of arity 0. We denote with S++ the collection of all the introduced R++ symbols. We now reduce the spectrum recognition problem for \u03c6 to probabilistic inference from a knowledge base in the signature S \u222a S+ \u222a S++ \u222a {a(), b()}.\nThe first formula in our knowledge base is\na() \u2227 \u00ac\u03c6R-Skol(x) : 0 (A1)\nWe now approximately axiomatize the functional nature of the symbols R+ \u2208 S+.\nThe sentence (8) can be directly encoded as a weighted formula:\nR+(x, y) \u2227R+(x, y\u2032) \u2227 y 6= y\u2032 : 0 (A2)\nNext, we would like to enforce (9) by means of a weighted formula. However, (9) encodes the essence of the existential quantifiers we are about to eliminate, and, thus, it is not surprising that this is not possible to enforce strictly. However, we can reward models in which the existential quantification of (9) is satisfied via the weighted formulas\na() \u2227R+(x, y) : w (R+ \u2208 S+) (A3)\nwhere w > 1 is a weight whose exact value is to be defined later.\nWe now proceed with constraining models of the reference proposition b(). First,\nall symbols in S \u222a S+ shall have an empty interpretations in models of b():\nb() \u2227R(x) : 0 (R \u2208 S) (A4)\nb() \u2227R+(x, y) : 0 (R+ \u2208 S+) (A5)\nIn order to allow b()-models to gain some weight, we use the extra symbols in\nS++:\nb() \u2227R++(x) : w (R++ \u2208 S++) (A6)\nwhere w is the same weight as in (A3). To further limit the possible interpretations of b()-models, we also stipulate:\nb() \u2227 \u00acR++(x) : 0 (R++ \u2208 S++) (A7)\nThe extra symbols R++ must have empty interpretations in a()-models:\na() \u2227R++(x) : 0 (R++ \u2208 S++) (A8)\nFinally, we add:\n\u00ac(a() \u2228 b()) : 0 (A9)\nWe now determine (approximately) WKB,n(a()) and WKB,n(b()) for the cases\nn \u2208 spec(\u03c6) and n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6).\nFirst, consider b(): for any n, there exists exactly one interpretation Ib() \u2208 I(Dn, S \u222a S+ \u222a S++ \u222a {a(), b()}) with nonzero weight in which b() is true. This is the interpretation in which all relations in S \u222a S+ are empty ((A4),(A5)), all relations in S++ are maximal (A7), and, in consequence of the latter, because of (A8), a() is false.\nAssume that S+ = {R+1 , . . . , R + m}, where R + i has arity ki +1. Then R ++ i \u2208 S ++\ncontributes via (A6) a factor of wn ki\nto WKB,n(Ib()), and the total weight is:\nWKB,n(Ib()) = WKB,n(b()) = w nk1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+nkm = wK(n), (A10)\nusing for abbreviation K(n) := nk1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ nkm .\nWe next turn to WKB,n(a()) in the case n \u2208 spec(\u03c6). Then there exists at least one interpretation I \u2208 I(Dn, S \u222a S+), in which \u2200x\u03c6R-Skol(x) is true, and in which the relations from S+ have a functional interpretation. We can expand this interpretation to an interpretation in I(n, S \u222aS+ \u222aS++ \u222a{a(), b()}) by giving all relations in S++ an empty interpretation, and setting a() to true and b() to false. Then I does not violate any hard constraint in KB, and collects from (A3) a total weight of wK(n). Thus\nWKB,n(a()) \u2265 w K(n),\nand therefore, when n \u2208 spec(\u03c6)\nPKB,n(a()) \u2265 WKB,n(a())/(WKB,n(a()) +WKB,n(b())) \u2265 1/2. (A11)\nFinally, we have to consider WKB,n(a()) in the case n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6). For any I with nonzero weight in which a() is true, because of (A1), also \u2200x\u03c6R-Skol(x) must be true. This, now, only is possible when some R+ \u2208 S+ is not a functional relation, which, because of (A2) can only mean that for some x there exists no y with R+(x, y). The total weight of I accrued from (A3) then is at most wK(n)\u22121. Because of (A8), I cannot obtain any additional weight from (A6), so that\nWKB,n(I) \u2264 w K(n)\u22121. (A12)\nThe total number of interpretations in I(Dn, S \u222aS+ \u222aS++ \u222a{a(), b()}) is 2L(n) for a polynomial L(n). Thus\nWKB,n(a()) \u2264 2 L(n)wK(n)\u22121. (A13)\nWe now obtain for the case n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6)\nPKB,n(a()) \u2264 WKB,n(a())/WKB,n(b()) \u2264 2 L(n)wK(n)\u22121/wK(n) = 2L(n)/w. (A14)\nSetting w = 10 \u00b72L(n), we thus have PKB,n(a()) \u2264 1/10 if n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6). The representation size of w is polynomial in n. Thus, an algorithm that computes PKB,n(a()) up to an accuracy of 0.2 = (0.5\u2212 0.1)/2 in time polynomial in n and the represen-\ntation size of w would give a polynomial time decision procedure for spec(\u03c6).\nProof of Theorem 4.4: The proof is an extension of the proof of Theorem 4.3, and we here just give the necessary modifications.\nLet E be a new binary relation symbol. We replace equalities x = y in (A1) and (A2) with E(x, y). To (approximately) axiomatize E as the identity relation in models of a(), we add to the knowledge base consisting of (A1)-(A9) the weighted formulas\na() \u2227 \u00acE(x, x) 0 (A15)\na() \u2227 E(x, y) 1/w (A16)\nwhere w > 1 is the same weight as in (A3) and (A6), and whose exact value is to be determined later. To calibrate the weight of b()-models, we introduce in analogy to the R++ relations a unary relation E++, and in analogy to (A6) - (A8) add to the knowledge base\nb() \u2227 E++(x) 1/w (A17)\nb() \u2227 \u00acE++(x) 0 (A18)\na() \u2227 E++(x) 0 (A19)\nWe now obtain for all n\nWKB,n(b()) = w K(n)(1/w)n = wK(n)\u2212n. (A20)\nIf n \u2208 spec(\u03c6), then there exists an interpretation in which a() is true, the R+ have a functional interpretation, and the interpretation of E is the identity relation. We can thus lower-bound the weight of a() by the weight of that interpretation:\nWKB,n(a()) \u2265 w K(n)(1/w)n = wK(n)\u2212n. (A21)\nAs in (A11), one then obtains PKB,n(a()) \u2265 1/2.\nWe now turn to the case n 6\u2208 spec(\u03c6). Consider any I in which a() is true, and that has nonzero weight. This now, only is possible when in I there is an R+ \u2208 S+ which is not a functional relation, or when E is not the identity relation in I (or both). In all cases, the weight of I coming from (A3) and (A16) is at most wK(n)\u2212n\u22121. The total number of interpretations in I(Dn, S \u222a S+ \u222a S++ \u222a {a(), b(), E}) is 2M(n) for a polynomial M(n). Thus\nWKB,n(a()) \u2264 2 M(n)wK(n)\u2212n\u22121, (A22)\nfrom which, as in (A14), then PKB,n(a()) \u2264 2M(n)/w. Now setting w = 10 \u00b7 2M(n) again yields the bound PKB,n(a()) \u2264 1/10."}], "references": [{"title": "Extended lifted inference with joint formulas", "author": ["U. Apsel", "R.I.

Numerous approaches for such \u201clifted inference\u201d techniques have been proposed. While it has been demonstrated that these techniques will lead to significantly more efficient inference on some specific models, there are only very recent and still quite restricted results that show the feasibility of lifted inference on certain syntactically defined classes of models. Lower complexity bounds that imply some limitations for the feasibility of lifted inference on more expressive model classes were established earlier in (Jaeger 2000). However, it is not immediate that these results also apply to the type of modeling languages that currently receive the most attention, i.e., weighted, quantifier-free formulas. In this paper we extend these earlier results, and show that under the assumption that NETIME6 =ETIME, there is no polynomial lifted inference algorithm for knowledge bases of weighted, quantifierand function-free formulas. Further strengthening earlier results, this is also shown to hold for approximate inference, and for knowledge bases not containing the equality predicate.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
