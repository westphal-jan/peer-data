Presenting a course that meets the needs of teachers requires the right choice of text, which seems difficult because of the lack of tools allowing access to the texts according to desired criteria. \"Although the text search seems to be a recurring tasks in language teaching, it seems that few tools have been designed to enable teachers to access texts based on criteria related to their problems \"(Loiseau et al., 2008) 1 .

It's just an automated machine to correct multiple choices, with four buttons (one per response). When the student press the right button it switches to the next question. 3\nBut the starting point of EIAH (environments for human learning) is the programmed learning.  The programmed learning: is \"a teaching method\" that transmits knowledge directly without the intermediary of a teacher or a monitor, this while respecting the characteristics of individual students. This teaching is based on four principles:\n The principle of structuring the subject to be taught (this is to cut and present the\nsubject so as to facilitate comprehension and memorization).\n The principle of adaptation (teaching must be adapted to the student)  The principle of stimulation  The principle of control\n Computer Assisted Education (French abbreviation: EAO) is actually born in the early\n60s and it is only in the 70s, the work on expert systems appear the first attempts to make \"intelligent \"EAO.

The agent of these operations is not specified. So we can imagine several configurations: the analysis can be performed by a human operator or a machine, and the expression of concepts extracted in documentary language can be performed either by a human or a machine. 9\nIn our case, the indexing operation will involve the user and the system. The user is not a documentalist and as a teacher, it is primarily the use case \"text's search\" which interests him. Both sides of the indexing process will therefore be as simple and not boring as possible and to do that, they must be automated as possible.\nThe analysis of some concepts of the document cannot be automated, such as the author or title (if these criteria are relevant to their operation in language teaching). But any automated analysis must be supported by the system. The analysis part of the indexing will\nbe hybrid in the sense that some concepts cannot be managed by the system, but the most fastidious will be automated where possible.\nIn what follows, we will explain the influence of pedagogical context on the choice of the text, before exploring the existing standard description of educational resources so that we may adapted to the specificity of the Arabic language and needs users, and then introduce the notion of facet of a text and present a model in which it occurs."}, {"heading": "2.5 Influence of pedagogic context in the choice of the text", "text": "After the formulation of the problem (setting up an activity), a text was assigned successively projected properties. We call these properties specified at progressively steps, the learning environment.

For that, you have to add semantic information. This information is metadata: data describing data 12 .\nFor that metadata fulfill their role and facilitate access to online resources, it is imperative that a stable standard that exists to providers of resource and users can use the same repository. This standard must also support developments and extensions to accommodate new needs.\nThe Learning Object Metadata (LOM) is a standard published in 2002 by the Learning Technology Standards Commitee (LTSC) de l\u2019IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). The standard consists of four parts: \u2022 IEEE 1484.12.1 - Conceptual model of metadata; \u2022 IEEE 1484.12.2 - Implementation of ISO / IEC 11404 in the LOM metadata model; \u2022 IEEE 1484.12.3 - Development and implementation of the XML Schema for LOM; \u2022 IEEE 1484.12.4 - Definition of application framework RDF (Resource Description Framework) for LOM. 13\nAll LOM elements are optional, that is to say that the model can work without all the fields are filled. Nevertheless, it is desirable to provide the most information so that resources can be exploited. The LOM is organized into nine categories performing different functions. The elements contained in each category can be seen in Figure 3.\nFigure3: Organization of LOM metadata scheme.14\nThe LOM standard is:\n Fairly complex because it includes 78 elements forming a tree on three floors and\noffers 59 fields of information independent.\n An Abstract model which must be instantiated in a particular context. It is therefore\nto adapt this standard to respond to specific and real needs of users.\nThis work of adaptation led to the definition of an \"application profile\".\nguage\n\"An application profile is a set of elements selected from one or more metadata schemas and combined in a composite diagram ... Its purpose is to adapt existing schemes to provide a tailor-made to all the functional requirements of a particular application, while remaining interoperable with the original patterns \" 15\nAll existing application profiles have some common characteristics:\n Assigning a degree of obligation to schema elements (mandatory, recommended,\noptional)\n The addition of new elements characterizing the environment of use of resources.  Defining vocabularies most appropriate to learning conditions (level of students,\nlevel of understanding ...).\nAmong the application profiles we quote:\n Normetic16: an application profile which terms of documentation elements include\nfour statuses: required, conditionally required, recommended or optional. One of these four statutes was assigned to each element selected for Normetic.\n Celebrate17: There are two types of subsets of elements defined here: the elements\nthat must be met in all instances of the metadata (mandatory elements) and elements that would be very useful to be filled (Recommended Elements) . All other elements of the set CELEBRATE are considered optional.\n SCORM18: Earlier versions of SCORM defined notion of a field mandatory or op-\ntional, while SCORM \u00ae 2004 defined all elements of the data model as required. In other words, a consistent LMS SCORM \u00ae 2004 must implement the entire data model.\n Cancore19: He only recommends the use of LOM elements for the purpose of in-\nteroperability in distributed environments."}, {"heading": "3 Grammar, composition and characteristics of Arabic", "text": "Arabic is a language that:\n The words are written in horizontal lines from right to left.

Example: \" \u0631 \u0633 \u0643\" is a verb that admits\nthe passive name \"\u0631\u0648\u0633\u0643\u0645\" following the pattern \"\u0644\u0648\u0639\u0641\u0645\"\n The name of the place (or time) is a deverbal which means the place (or time). Example: \"\u0633\u0631\u062f\" \"\u0629\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0645\"  The name of manner: it indicates how the action expressed by the verbe.20\nb. Inflexional morphology (\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0627), Arabic is an inflected language concerned by the casual marking for noun and the adjective or the conjugation of verb.\n Flexion of verbs: The conjugation of verb describes the variation of its shape de-\npending on the mode and time used.\n The past \"\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\": it indicates that the action expressed by the verb is completed and it is characterized by the suf-\nfix of the verb according to gender, number... Example: the verb \"\u0628\u0647\u0630\" he adds \"\u0627\" for dual masculine and \"\u0627\u062a\" for female duel.  The future \"\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0636\u0645\u0644\u0627\": it indicates that the action expressed by the verb is incomplete and is characterized by\nprefixation of the verb and one or more suffixation according to gender, number...  The imperative \" \u0627\u0631\u0645\u0644\u0623 \": it expresses the order with the 2nd person singular, dual and plural (or female). With the exception of the verbs that follow regular forms of conjugation, there are irregular verbs requiring special handling. 20\n Flexion of nouns : The nominal Arabic system has various systems of declination.\nWe can distinguish:\n Declination of base (singular): it takes the vowel \"\u0629\u0645\u0636\" as nominative and the vowel \"\u0629\u062d\u062a\u0641\" as accusative and\nthe vowel \"\u0629\u0631\u0633\u0643 as genitive. When the name is undefined, the\" tanwin \"is marked by signs following: (un), (an) and (in).  Declination of diptotes (singular): the example of male adjectives of colors which they follow the scheme \"\u0644\u0639\u0641\u0623\"\nas \"\u0631\u0641\u0635\u0623\" and follow the feminine the scheme \"\u0621\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0641\" as \"\u0621\u0627\u0636\u064a\u0628\".  Declination of deverbal of defective roots: as an example of passive participles that end in \"\u0649\" or \"\u0627\" as \"\u0649\u0641\u0639\u0645\",\nthey lose their inflection. There are also verbal nouns which have a form such as \"\u0636\u0627\u0642\" and are generally al-\nguage\ntered to \"\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0642\" by adding the glide \"\u064a\" at the end of the initial form.  Declination of the name in the duel: To define the dual of a defined or undefined name, we suffix him by \"\u0646\u0627\"\nin nominative and \"\u0646\u064a\" in the accusative and the genitive. But there are always exceptions like the case of words ending by \" \u0621\" ,\"\u064a\" ,\"\u0648 \" whose termination is transformed before adding the suffix of duel. Example: \"\u0649\u0647\u0644\u0645\" \u00e0 \"\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0647\u0644\u0645\".  Declination of the plural noun: For regular masculine plural we suffix it by \"\u0646\u0648\" or \"\u0646\u064a\" as \"\u0631\u0643\u0641\u0645\" \u00e0 \"\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0643\u0641\u0645\".\nFor regular feminine plural we suffix it by \"\u062a\u0627\" as \" \u0633\u0648\u0629\u062f\u0627 \" \u00e0 \"\u062a\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0633\u0648.\" Of course there is the broken plural nouns that require changes and infixation of their singulars and whose do not follow own variations.\n Flexion of tools word: There are tools words not declinable such as \"\u0649\u0644\u0625\" and other declinable as the quantifier \" \u0644\u0643\" which he ac-\ncepts the final three vowels of the nominative, accusative and genitive. 20"}, {"heading": "3.8 Recent classification of Arabic units", "text": "To our knowledge, studies that are made to classify lexical units of the Arabic language according to parts of speech are very few 21 .

Indeed, the text, like other raw resources, is difficult to catalog pedagogically using existing standards because of too large instrumental fields. On the other hand, the texts can be used in different contexts, then, consider pedagogical properties as intrinsic can cause problems. In this case, we felt it appropriate to use the expertise of teachers by asking them, as a questionnaire, reflecting on their practices. Our hypotheses of working are: Hyp1: one of tasks of language's teachers is the text search; Hyp2: text searching is done firstly, for a specific activity; Hyp3: a text can be used in different contexts (different levels, different exercises ...); Hyp4: in the choice of text, the focus is on specific vocabularies; Hyp5: text length has an effect on his choice; Hyp6: the use of the text relates, derivational morphology much more than inflectional morphology;\nguage\nHyp7: the type of exercise most used is the text with blanks;\nIn our questionnaire (see Appendix) we asked a group of teachers (60 teachers, fewer but just to know the opinion of a community of teachers) whose have experience ranging from 4 years and 26 years and whose teach students ranging in age from 7 years and 18 years, that is to say, from primary to secondary level.

Question Number 2 is composed of three parts:\n In a first step we asked teachers if they have personal collections, which led us to a result which the majority of teachers (95%) responded 'yes'.\n Among the teachers who answered 'yes', we have 92.98% of them who have oganized collections.\nThese collections are organized as shown in Table 5 by:\n The subject  The students' level  The course\nstatistical variables Effectives (ni) frequency (fi)\n\u0639\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0633\u062d (according on the subject)\n03 5.66%\n\u0630\u064a\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0644\u0627 \u0649\u0648\u062a\u0633\u0645 \u0628\u0633\u062d (according on the level of students)\n03 5.66%\n\u0633\u0631\u062f\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0633\u062d (according to the objective of the course)\n47 88.67%\nTotal 53 100%\nAccording to Table5 and Figure6 representative of the table we deduced that most teachers have an organized collection according to the objective of the course and then come the subject and the level of students in 2nd place with equal percentages.\nQuestion 3 deals with the manner in which the teacher obtained his texts by giving three proposals (see table 6 and figure 7):\n Search for a physical activity\nguage\n They get it through a personal reading  Are in the official program\nstatistical variables Effectives (ni) frequency (fi)\n1 st choice 2nd choice 3rd choice 1 st choice 2nd choice 3rd choice\n\u0646\u064a\u0639\u0645 \u0637\u0627\u0634\u0646 \u0644\u062c\u0623 \u0646\u0645 \u062b\u062d\u0628 (Search for a particular activity) 52 03 02 86.66% 05% 3.33%\n\u0629\u064a\u0635\u062e\u0634 \u0629\u0621\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0644\u0644\u0627\u062e \u0646\u0645 \u0647\u064a\u0644\u0639 \u062a\u0644\u0635\u062d\u062a\n(you get it through a personal\nreading)\n01 12 12 1.66% 20% 20%\n\u062f\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0631\u0628\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0641 (Exists in the\nprogram)\n07 43 44 11.66% 71.66% 73.33%\nNo response 00 02 02 00% 3.33% 3.33%\nTotal 60 60 60 100% 100% 100%\nIn this question, teachers are required to classify the answers according to priorities.

Analysis of the results led us to conclude that the majority of teachers (86.66%) have obtained texts when searching for a specific activity, then come in 2nd place predefined text in the program with a percentage of 71.66%. This finding allowed us to prove the Hyp2 and thereafter we will be based on the text searched for a specific activity in the first place, then the texts of the program. When we had to prove or refute the Hyp3, we focused on question 6 which these results are summarized in table 7 and illustrated by Figure 8.\nstatistical variables Effectives (ni) frequency (fi)\n\u0645\u0639\u0646(yes) 59 98.33%\n\u0644\u0627(no) 01 1.66% Total 60 100%\nWe found that a percentage of 98.33% of the teachers confirmed the hyp3 concerning the use of a text in different contexts, and 1.66% (a single teacher) which held that each text has its own context. This allows us to prove our hypothesis. Question number 7 asks the teacher about what criteria the most insists on his choice of text, with giving him three proposals (see Table 8 and Figure 9):\n Certain statements in the context of the lesson  The subject on which the text unfolds  the length of the text\nguage\nFigure9: Diagram showing the results of the 7th question of the questionnaire\nFrom Table8 and Figure 9 we see that teachers focus in the first rank on certain statements in the context of the lesson (81.66%) and in the 2nd place on the subject and the text length. This proves the Hyp4. On the other hand the length of the text has an effect on his choice, indeed all teachers confirm the Hyp5 with a percentage of 100%. We also deduced that all the teachers are always try to choose a length of text most minimum possible (see table 9).\nRegarding the use of text, we deduced that all teachers use texts for inflectional morphology and derivational morphology (Question9), but they are mainly used it for derivational morphology with different categories (Question9.C), which proves the Hyp6. To learn more about what type of inflectional and derivational morphology teachers use the text, we proposed the two issues which Q9.B Q9.A and their results are made in tables 10 and 11 and their presentations in Figures 11 and 12.\nFigure11: Diagram showing the results of the questionnaire the question 9.A\nguage\nstatistical variables Effectives (ni) frequency (fi)\n\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0648\u0646 (types of sen-\ntences) (1) 02 3.33%\n\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0644\u0623\u0627 \u0639\u0648\u0646 (types of nouns)\n(2) 00 00%\n\u0628\u064a\u0643\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0648\u0646 (types of compo-\nsitions) (3) 01 1.66%\n(1)+(3) 03 05% (1) +(2) +(3) 54 90%\nTotal 60 100%\nAccording to previous results, we find that teachers use verbs with varying times and different pronouns, they do not focus on one time or one pronoun. On inflectional morphology, we find that they do not exploit the texts for one type, but they exploit it either for the types of sentences, the types of pronouns or the types of compositions.\nAll the teachers also judge that the use of texts is made especially to inflectional morphology than derivational morphology. We know that teachers are using variations of exercises, which lead us to ask a question about the type most used.
