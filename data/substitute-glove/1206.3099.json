The approach relies on convex regularization, common in compressive sensing, to enhance the detection of sparsity via a diffusive process over the network. The resulting algorithms endow networks with learning abilities and allow them to learn the sparse structure from the incoming data in real-time, and also to track variations in the sparsity of the model. We provide convergence and mean-square performance analysis of the proposed method and show under what conditions it outperforms the unregularized diffusion version. We also show how to adaptively select the regularization parameter.

INTRODUCTION\nWe consider the problem of distributed mean-square-error estimation, where a set of nodes is required to collectively estimate some vector parameter of interest from noisy measurements by relying solely on in-network processing. We consider an ad-hoc network consisting of N nodes that are distributed over some geographic region. At every time instant i, every node k collects a scalar measurement dk(i) of some random process dk(i) and a 1 \u00d7 M regression vector uk,i of some random process uk,i with\nCopyright (c) 2012 IEEE.

The objective is for the nodes in the network to use the collected data {dk(i), uk,i} to estimate some M \u00d7 1 parameter vector wo in a distributed manner. There are a couple of distributed strategies that have been developed in the literature for such purposes. One typical strategy is the incremental approach [1]-[5], where each node communicates only with one neighbor at a time over a cyclic path. In the incremental strategy, information is processed in a cyclic manner across the nodes of the network until optimization is achieved. However, determining a cyclic path that covers all nodes is an NP-hard problem [6] and, in addition, cyclic trajectories are prone to link and node failures. When any of the edges along the path fails, the sharing of data through the cycle is interrupted and the algorithm stops performing. To address these difficulties, adaptive diffusion techniques were proposed and studied in [7], [8]. In diffusion implementations, the nodes exchange information locally and cooperate with each other without the need for a central processor. In this way, information is processed on the fly by all nodes and the data diffuse across the network by means of a real-time sharing mechanism. The resulting adaptive networks exploit the time and spatial-diversity of the data more fully, thus endowing networks with powerful learning and tracking abilities. In view of their robustness and adaptation properties, diffusion networks have been applied to model a variety of self-organized behavior encountered in nature, such as birds flying in formation [12], fish foraging for food [13] or bacteria motility [14]. Diffusion adaptation has also been used to solve dynamic resource allocation problems in cognitive radios [15], to perform robust system modeling [18], and to implement distributed learning over mixture models in pattern recognition applications [16].\nIn many situations, the parameter of interest, wo, is sparse, containing only a few relatively large coefficients among many negligible ones. Any prior information about the sparsity of wo can be exploited to help improve the estimation performance, as demonstrated in many recent efforts in the area of compressive sensing (CS) [27]-[29]. Nevertheless, most CS efforts so far have concentrated on batch recovery methods, where the estimation of the desired vector is achieved from a collection of a fixed number of measurements. In this paper, we are instead interested in adaptive (online) techniques that allow the recovery of the vector wo to be pursued both recursively and distributively as new data arrive at the nodes. More importantly, we are interested in schemes that allow the recovery process to track changes in the sparsity pattern of the vector over time. Such schemes are useful in several contexts such as in the analysis of prostate cancer data [28], [41], spectrum sensing in cognitive radio [45], and spectrum estimation in wireless sensor networks [46].\nSome of the early works that mix adaptation with sparsity-aware constructions include methods that rely on the heuristic selection of active taps [20]-[22], and on sequential partial updating techniques [23]-\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n3 [24]; some other methods assign proportional step-sizes to different taps according to their magnitudes, such as the proportionate normalized LMS (PNLMS) algorithm and its variations [25]-[26]. In subsequent studies, motivated by the LASSO technique [28] and by connections with compressive sensing [29], [30], several algorithms for sparse adaptive filtering have been proposed based on LMS [34]-[35], RLS [36], [37], and projection-based methods [38]-[39]. A couple of distributed algorithms implementing LASSO over ad-hoc networks have also been considered before, although their main purpose has been to use the network to solve a batch processing problem [40], [41]. One basic idea in all these previously developed sparsity-aware techniques is to introduce a convex penalty term into the cost function to favor sparsity.\nHowever, these earlier contributions did not consider the design of both adaptive and distributed solutions that are able to exploit and track sparsity while at the same time processing data in realtime and in a fully decentralized manner. Doing so would endow networks with learning abilities and would allow them to learn the sparse structure from the incoming data recursively and, therefore, to track variations in the sparsity pattern of the underlying vector as well. Investigations on adaptive and distributed solutions appear in [42],[43], and [44]. In [42], we employed diffusion techniques that are able to identify and track sparsity over networks in a distributed manner; the techniques relied on the use of convenient convex regularization terms. In the related work [43], the authors employ projection techniques onto hyperslabs and weighted \u21131-balls to develop a useful sparsity-aware algorithm for distributed learning over diffusion networks. In [44], the authors use the same formulation of [42] and the techniques of [7]- [8] to independently arrive at useful diffusion strategies except that they limit the function f(\u00b7) in (2) to choices of the form \u2016w\u2016p, for particular selections of p-vector norms; they also include the regularization factor into the combination step of their algorithm rather than in the adaptation step, as done further ahead in this work. The algorithms proposed here and in [42] are more general in a couple of respects: they allow for broader choices of the regularization function f(\u00b7), they allow for sharing of both data and weight estimates among the nodes (and not only estimates) by allowing for the use of two sets of combinations weights {al,k, cl,k} instead of only one set, and the resulting mean-square and stability analyses are more demanding due to these generalizations; see, e.g., Appendices A and B. We further use the results of the analysis to propose an adaptive method to adjust online the important regularization parameter \u03b3 in (2). This is an important step in order to endow the resulting diffusion strategies with full adaptation abilities: adaptation to nonstationarities in the data and to changes in the sparsity patterns of the data.\nThe approach we follow in this work is based on developing diffusion strategies that are stable in the mean-square-error sense, with guaranteed performance bounds. For this reason, a detailed mean-square-\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n4 error analysis is carried out in order to examine the behavior of the algorithm in the presence of noisy measurements and random regression data. The analysis ends up suggesting a convenient method for adapting the regularization parameter in a distributed manner as well. Doing so, enhances the sparsityawareness of the algorithm and adds another useful layer of adaptation to the operation of the network. In summary, in this paper we extend our preliminary work in [42] to develop adaptive networks running diffusion algorithms subject to constraints that enforce sparsity. We consider two convex regularization constraints. In one case, we consider an \u21131-norm regularization term, which acts as a uniform zeroattractor. In another case, and in order to improve the estimation performance, we employ reweighted regularization to selectively promote sparsity on the zero elements of wo, rather than uniformly on all the elements. We provide detailed convergence analysis of the proposed methods, giving a closed form expression for the bias on the estimate due to regularization. We carry out a mean-square-error analysis, showing the conditions under which the sparse diffusion filter outperforms its unregularized version in terms of steady-state performance. It turns out that, if the system model is sufficiently sparse, it is possible to tune a single parameter to outperform the standard diffusion algorithm. Then, on the basis of this result, we propose a method to adaptively choose the regularization parameter. In this way, the network is able to learn the sparse structure from the incoming data recursively and to adjust its parameters for improved tracking. The main contributions of this paper are therefore: (a) exploitation of sparsity for distributed estimation over adaptive networks; (b) derivation of the mean-square properties of the sparse diffusion adaptive filter; (c) and adaptation of the regularization parameter to enhance performance under sparsity.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we develop the sparse diffusion algorithm for distributed adaptive estimation. Section III provides performance analysis, which includes mean stability, meansquare performance and adaptation of the regularization parameter. Section IV provides simulation results in support of the theoretical analysis, and section V draws some conclusions.\nNotation: we use bold face letters to denote random variables and normal font letters to denote their\nrealizations.

SPARSE DISTRIBUTED ESTIMATION OVER ADAPTIVE NETWORKS", "text": "We assume the data {dk(i),uk,i} collected by the various nodes are related to an unknown sparse vector wo via the linear model:\ndk(i) = uk,iw o + vk(i) (1)\nwhere vk(i) is a zero mean random variable with variance \u03c32v,k, independent of ul,j for all l and j, and independent of vl(j) for l 6= k and i 6= j. Linear models of the form (1) arise frequently in applications\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n5 and are able to represent many cases of interest. The cooperative sparse estimation problem is cast as the search for the optimal estimator that minimizes in a fully distributed manner the following cost function:\nJglob(w) =\nN \u2211\nk=1\nE|dk(i)\u2212 uk,iw|2 + \u03b3f(w) (2)\nwhere E(\u00b7) denotes the expectation operator, and f(w) is a real-valued convex regularization function weighted by the parameter \u03b3 > 0, which is used to enforce sparsity of the solution. The optimization problem in (2) may be solved in a centralized fashion. In this approach, the nodes send their data to a central processor, or fusion center, where all computations can be performed. Centralized implementations of this type require transmitting data back and forth between the nodes and the central processor, which translates into requirements of power and bandwidth resources. Additionally, centralized solutions have a serious point of failure: if the central processor fails, then the network operation is adversely affected and operation comes to a halt. For these reasons, we are interested in distributed solutions, where each node communicates with its neighboring nodes, and processing is distributed among all nodes in the network. In this way, communications are localized, and even when individual nodes fail, the network can continue to operate."}, {"heading": "A. Adaptive Diffusion Strategy", "text": "We follow the approach proposed in [8], [11] to derive distributed strategies for the minimization of Jglob(w) in (2). We start by introducing an N \u00d7N matrix C with non-negative entries {cl,k} such that\ncl,k > 0 if l \u2208 Nk, C1 = 1, (3)\nwhere 1 denotes the N \u00d7 1 vector with unit entries and Nk denotes the neighborhood of node k. Each coefficient cl,k represents a weight value that node k assigns to information arriving from its neighbor l. Of course, the coefficient cl,k is equal to zero when nodes l and k are not connected. Furthermore, each row of C adds up to one so that the sum of all weights leaving each node l should be one. Using the coefficients in (3), the global cost function in (2) can be expressed as:\nJglob(w) = J lock (w) + \u2211\nl 6=k\nJ locl (w) + \u03b3f(w) (4)\nwhere\nJ lock (w) ,\nN \u2211\nl=1\ncl,kE|dl(i)\u2212 ul,iw|2 (5)\nThe function introduced in (5) is a local (neighborhood) cost for node k; it involves a weighted combination of the costs of its neighbors without considering the sparsity constraint. Assuming the processes\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n6 dk(i) and uk,i are jointly wide sense stationary, the minimization of the local cost function (5) over w leads to the optimal local solution:\nwlock =\n(\nN \u2211\nl=1\ncl,kRu,l\n)\u22121( N \u2211\nl=1\ncl,krdu,l\n)\n(6)\nwhere Ru,k = Eu\u2217k,iuk,i is assumed positive-definite (i.e., Ru,k > 0) and rdu,k = Edk(i)u \u2217 k,i, where the operator \u2217 denotes complex-conjugate transposition. Thus, the local estimate wlock is based solely on local covariance data {Ru,l, rdu,l}l\u2208Nk from the neighborhood of node k. If we multiply both sides of (1) by u\u2217k,i and take expectations and then add over the neighborhood of node k, it is easy to verify that the estimate wlock from (6) agrees with the desired vector w o. Therefore, in principle, each node k can estimate wo if it knows the moments {Ru,l, rdu,l}. Often, in practice, these moments are not available and nodes only sense realizations of data arising from these statistical distributions. In that case, cooperation among the nodes can help them improve their estimates of wo from the data realizations. To motivate the cooperative procedure, we start by noting that a completion of squares argument shows that (5) can be rewritten in terms of wlock as\nJ lock (w) = \u2016w \u2212 wlock \u20162\u0393k + mmse (7)\nwhere mmse is a constant term that does not depend on w, the notation \u2016a\u20162\u03a3 = a\u2217\u03a3a, for any nonnegative definite matrix \u03a3, and\n\u0393k ,\nN \u2211\nl=1\ncl,kRu,l. (8)\nThus, using (4), (5) and (7), and dropping the constant mmse terms, we can replace the original global cost (2) with the equivalent cost:\nJglob \u2032 (w) = \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\ncl,kE|dl(i)\u2212 ul,iw|2 + \u2211\nl 6=k\n\u2016w \u2212 wlocl \u20162\u0393l + \u03b3f(w) (9)\nExpression (9) shows how the local cost J lock (w) can be modified to approach the desired global cost; two correction terms appear on the right-hand side: the regularization term \u03b3f(w) and a sum involving the local estimates {wlocl }. Node k cannot minimize (9) directly. This is because the cost in (9) still requires the nodes to have access to global information, namely, the local estimates {wlocl }, and the matrices {\u0393l}, from all other nodes in the network. To enable a distributed and iterative procedure, we make three adjustments to (9).\nFirst, we limit the sum over l 6= k to a sum over the neighbors of node k, i.e., only over l \u2208 Nk. This step is reasonable since node k can only rely on data that are available to it from its neighborhood.\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n7 Second, we replace the covariance matrices \u0393l with constant diagonal weighting matrices of the form \u0393l = bl,kIM , where bl,k is a set of non-negative real coefficients that give different weights to different neighbors, and IM is the M \u00d7M identity matrix. Although the {\u0393l} from its neighbors are available to node k, this step is meant to simplify the structure of the resulting algorithm. This substitution is also reasonable in view of the fact that norms are equivalent and that each of the weighted norms in (9) can be bounded as\n\u03bbmin(\u0393l) \u00b7 \u2016w \u2212 wlocl \u20162 \u2264 \u2016w \u2212 wlocl \u20162\u0393l \u2264 \u03bbmax(\u0393l) \u00b7 \u2016w \u2212 wlocl \u20162 (10)\nSubstitutions of this kind are common in the stochastic approximation literature where Hessian matrices, such as \u0393l, are replaced by multiples of the identity matrix; such approximations allow the use of simpler steepest-descent iterations in place of Newton-type iterations [11]. At this stage, we do not need to worry about the selection of the weights {bl,k} because they are going to be embedded into another set of coefficients that the designer can choose. Finally, while the nodes are attempting to estimate wo, they do not know what the optimal local estimates wlocl are during the iterative learning process. As the ensuing discussion will reveal, each node in the resulting distributed algorithm will be working on estimating the sparse vector wo and will have access to a local estimate for wo, which we denote by \u03c8l at node l. Due to the diffusion process, this estimate will not be based solely on data from the neighborhood of node l but also on data from across the network. We are therefore motivated to replace wlocl in (9) by \u03c8l. In this way, each node k can instead minimize the following modified local cost function:\nJdistk (w) = \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\ncl,kE|dl(i)\u2212 ul,iw|2 + \u2211\nl\u2208Nk/{k}\nbl,k\u2016w \u2212 \u03c8l\u20162 + \u03b3f(w). (11)\nThe cost in (11) is now defined in terms of information that is available to node k. Observe that while (11) is a local approximation for the global cost (9), it is nevertheless more general than the local cost (5). The node k can then proceed to optimize (11) by means of a steepest-descent procedure. Note that all functions in (11) are continuously differentiable except possibly f(w), which is only supposed to be convex. Thus, computing the sub-gradient of (11) we obtain\n[\u2207Jdistk (w)]\u2217 = \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\ncl,k(Ru,lw \u2212 rdu,l) + \u2211\nl\u2208Nk/{k}\nbl,k(w \u2212 \u03c8l) + \u03b3\u2202f(w) (12)\nwhere \u2202f(w) is the sub-gradient of the convex function f(w). Then, we can use (12) to obtain a steepest descent recursion for the estimate of wo at node k at time i, denoted by wk,i, such as\nwk,i = wk,i\u22121 + \u00b5k \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\ncl,k(rdu,l \u2212Ru,lwk,i\u22121) + \u00b5k \u2211\nl\u2208Nk/{k}\nbl,k(\u03c8l \u2212 wk,i\u22121)\u2212 \u00b5k\u03b3\u2202f(wk,i\u22121) (13)\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n8 for some sufficiently small positive step-sizes {\u00b5k}. The update (13) involves the sum of three terms and we can compute it in two steps by generating an intermediate estimate \u03c8k,i, as follows:\n\u03c8k,i = wk,i\u22121 + \u00b5k \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\ncl,k(rdu,l \u2212Ru,lwk,i\u22121)\u2212 \u00b5k\u03b3\u2202f(wk,i\u22121) (14)\nwk,i = \u03c8k,i + \u00b5k \u2211\nl\u2208Nk/{k}\nbl,k(\u03c8l \u2212 wk,i\u22121) (15)\nSince every node in the network will be running recursions of the form (14)-(15), then the intermediate estimate of wo that is available to each node l at time i is \u03c8l,i. Therefore, we replace \u03c8l in (15) by \u03c8l,i. Moreover, since \u03c8k,i is an updated estimate relative to wk,i\u22121, as evidenced by (14), we are motivated to replace wk,i\u22121 in (15) by \u03c8k,i, which generally leads to enhanced performance since \u03c8k,i contains more information than wk,i\u22121. This step is reminiscent of an incremental-type substitution [1]-[5]. Performing these substitutions in (15), we get:\nwk,i = \u03c8k,i + \u00b5k \u2211\nl\u2208Nk/{k}\nbl,k(\u03c8l,i \u2212 \u03c8k,i) (16)\nIf we now introduce the entries of an N \u00d7N matrix A = {al,k} such that\nal,k , \u00b5kbl,k (l 6= k), ak,k , 1\u2212 \u00b5k \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\nbl,k, al,k = 0 if l /\u2208 Nk (17)\nthen, we can rewrite the update in (14)-(15) as: \n   \n   \n\u03c8k,i = wk,i\u22121 + \u00b5k \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\ncl,k(rdu,l \u2212Ru,lwk,i\u22121)\u2212 \u00b5k\u03b3\u2202f(wk,i\u22121)\nwk,i = \u2211\nl\u2208Nk\nal,k\u03c8l,i\n(18)\nwhere the weighting coefficients {al,k, cl,k} are real, non-negative and satisfy:\ncl,k > 0, al,k > 0 if l \u2208 Nk, C1 = 1, AT1 = 1. (19)\nThe recursion in (18) requires knowledge of the second-order moments {Ru,k, rdu,k}. An adaptive implementation can be obtained by replacing these second-order moments by local instantaneous approximations, say, of the LMS type, as follows:\nRu,k \u2243 u\u2217k,iuk,i, rdu,k \u2243 dk(i)u\u2217k,i. (20)\nThus, substituting the approximations (20) into (18), we arrive at the following Adapt-then-Combine (ATC) strategy. We refer to the algorithm as the ATC sparse diffusion algorithm. The first step in (21) is an adaptation step, where the coefficients cl,k determine which nodes l \u2208 Nk should share their\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n9 ATC sparse diffusion LMS\nStart with wk,\u22121 = 0 for all k.

The second step is a diffusion step where the intermediate estimates \u03c8l,i, from the neighbors l \u2208 Nk, are combined through the coefficients {al,k}. We remark that had we reversed the steps (14) and (15) to implement (13), we arrive at a similar but alternative strategy, known as the Combine-then-Adapt (CTA) strategy; in this implementation, the only difference is that data aggregation is performed before adaptation (see, e.g., [8]).

It was argued in [8] that ATC strategies generally outperform CTA strategies. For this reason, we continue our discussion by focusing on the ATC algorithm (21); similar analysis applies to CTA.\nCompared with the strategies proposed in [43] and [44], the diffusion algorithm (21) exploits data in the neighborhood more fully; the adaptation step aggregates data {dl(i), ul,i} from the neighbors, and the diffusion step aggregates estimates {\u03c8l,i} from the same neighbors. The implementation in [43] uses a different algorithmic structure with C = I so that data {dl(i), ul,i} from the neighbors are not directly used.

Thus, motivated by LASSO [28] and work on compressive sensing [29], we first consider the following \u21131-norm convex choice for a regularization function:\nf1(w) = \u2016w\u20161 , M \u2211\nm=1\n|wm| (24)\nwhich amounts to the sum of the absolute entries of the vectors. The \u21131-norm works as a surrogate approximation for the \u21130-norm. This choice leads to an algorithm update in (21) where the subgradient column vector is given by\n\u2202f1(w) = sign(w) (25)\nand the entries of the vector sign(w) are obtained by applying the following function to each entry of w:\nsign(wm) =\n  \n \nwm/|wm|, wm 6= 0\n0, wm = 0\n(26)\nThis update leads to what we shall refer to as the zero-attracting (ZA) diffusion algorithm. The ZA update uniformly shrinks all components of the vector, and does not distinguish between zero and nonzero elements [30], [34]. Since all the elements are forced toward zero uniformly, the performance would deteriorate for systems that are not sufficiently sparse. Motivated by the idea of reweighting in compressive sampling [30], [34],[38], we also consider the following approximation:\n\u2016w\u20160 \u2243 M \u2211\nm=1\n|wm| \u03b5+ |wm|\n(27)\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n11\nwhich, for very small positive values of \u03b5, is a better approximation for the \u21130-norm of a vector w than the \u21131-norm [30], thus enhancing sparse recovery by the algorithm. Therefore, interpreting (27) as a weighted \u21131-norm regularization, to update the algorithm in (21), we shall consider the following sub-gradient column vector:\n\u2202f2(w) = diag\n{\n1\n\u03b5+ |w1| ,\n1\n\u03b5+ |w2| , . . . ,\n1\n\u03b5+ |wM | ,\n}\n\u00b7 sign(w) (28)\nThis choice leads to what we shall refer to as the reweighted zero-attracting (RZA) diffusion algorithm. The update in (28) selectively shrinks only the components whose magnitudes are comparable to \u03b5, and there is little effect on components satisfying |wm| \u226b \u03b5, see, e.g., [30], [34], [38], [42], [44]."}, {"heading": "III.

Theorem 2 (Mean-Square Stability) Assume the data model (1) and Assumption 1 hold. Then, the sparse diffusion LMS algorithm (21) will be mean-square stable if the step-sizes are sufficiently small and satisfy (40), and the matrix F in (52) is stable. Proof: See Appendix B.

Now, since A is left-stochastic, it can be verified that the above F is stable if (I \u2212DM) is stable [11], [9]; this latter condition is guaranteed by (40). In summary, sufficiently small step-sizes ensure the stability of the diffusion strategy in the mean and mean-square senses.\nTaking the limit as i \u2192 \u221e (assuming the step-sizes are small enough to ensure convergence to a steady-state), we deduce from (53) that:\nlim i\u2192\u221e\nE\u2016w\u0303i\u20162(I\u2212F)\u03c3 = [vec(ATMGTMA)]T\u03c3 + \u03b3\u03b2\u03a3,\u221e ( \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1\u03a3,\u221e \u03b2\u03a3,\u221e )\n(55)\nwhere\n\u03b1\u03a3,\u221e = lim i\u2192\u221e\n\u22122E\u2202f(wi\u22121)TMA\u03a3AT (I \u2212MD) w\u0303i\u22121 (56)\n\u03b2\u03a3,\u221e = lim i\u2192\u221e\nE\u2016\u2202f(wi\u22121)\u20162MA\u03a3ATM (57)\nThe limits in (56)-(57) exist. Indeed, first, in Appendix C we show that \u03b1\u03a3,i converges to \u03b1\u03a3,\u221e. Second, we also show in Appendix B that the LHS of (55) converges. Therefore, the term \u03b2\u03a3,\u221e also exists.\nExpression (55) is a useful result: it allows us to derive several performance metrics through the proper selection of the free weighting parameter \u03c3 (or \u03a3), as was done in [8].

Then, denoting the vectorized version of the matrix Tk by tk = vec(diag(ek) \u2297 IM ), where ek is the vector whose k-th entry is one and zeros elsewhere, and if we select \u03c3 in (55) as \u03c3k = (I \u2212F)\u22121tk, we arrive at the MSD for node k:\nMSDk = [vec(ATMGTMA)]T (I \u2212F)\u22121tk + \u03b3\u03b2\u03a3k,\u221e ( \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1\u03a3k,\u221e \u03b2\u03a3k,\u221e )\n(58)\nThe average network MSDnet is given by:\nMSDnet = lim i\u2192\u221e\n1\nN\nN \u2211\nk=1\nE\u2016w\u0303k,i\u20162 (59)\nThen, to obtain the network MSD from (55), the weighting matrix of limi\u2192\u221e E\u2016w\u0303i\u20162T should be chosen as T = IMN/N .

The condition \u03c6\u03a3,i(\u03b3i) < 0 is satisfied when\n\u03b1\u03a3,i > 0 and 0 < \u03b3i < \u03b1\u03a3,i \u03b2\u03a3,i\n(70)\nSince \u03c6\u03a3,i(\u03b3i) in (67) is quadratic in \u03b3i, we can choose the optimal parameter that minimizes (67) as:\n\u03b3oi = max\n{\n0, \u03b1\u03a3,i 2\u03b2\u03a3,i\n}\n(71)\nNow, exploiting the small step-sizes assumption in (69), we consider the following approximation:\n\u03b1\u03a3,i \u2243 \u22122\u2202f(wi\u22121)TMAAT w\u0303i\u22121 (72)\nAn approximate expression for the sparsity parameter in (71) is then given by:\n\u03b3oi \u2243 max { 0, \u2212\u2202f(wi\u22121)TMAAT w\u0303i\u22121\n\u2016\u2202f(wi\u22121)\u20162MAATM\n}\n(73)\nRemark 2: The rule (73) cannot be directly used due to the presence of the true parameter vector wo in w\u0303i\u22121, which is unknown to the nodes in the network. Furthermore, the update (73) depends on data\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n18\ncoming from all nodes. However, in the sequel we propose some useful approximations that allow the local computation of the regularization parameter.\nFirst, we notice that the regularization parameter (73) depends on the combination matrix A, which influences how the nodes perform the combination step in (21). This step helps improve the quality of the node\u2019s estimate wk,i by reducing the effect of the measurement and gradient noises but, it generally has a marginal effect on the sparse recovery capability of the algorithm. The regularization function appears instead inside the adaptation step in (21). Thus, to simplify expression (73), we consider the case in which we want to select \u03b3i under the condition that A = I , i.e., no cooperation is performed among the nodes. In this case, the following relations hold:\n\u03b2\u03a3,i \u2243 N \u2211\nk=1\n\u00b52k\u2016\u2202f(wk,i\u22121)\u20162 (74)\n\u03b1\u03a3,i \u2243 \u22122 N \u2211\nk=1\n\u00b5k\u2202f(wk,i\u22121) T w\u0303k,i\u22121 (75)\nLet x = wk,i\u22121 and y = wo \u2212 wk,i\u22121. Using (62), we find that\n\u03b1\u03a3,i \u2243 \u22122 N \u2211\nk=1\n\u00b5k\u2202f(wk,i\u22121) T w\u0303k,i\u22121 \u2265 2\nN \u2211\nk=1\n\u00b5k[f(wk,i\u22121)\u2212 f(wo)] (76)\nIn practice, some prior knowledge about the sparsity of the true vector wo is often available. For example, the \u21131-norm of wo can be upper bounded by some constant value [28]. In this work, we assume that\nf(wo) \u2264 \u03b7, (77)\nfor some given positive constant \u03b7. Using (77) in (76), we get\n\u03b1\u03a3,i \u2265 2 N \u2211\nk=1\n\u00b5k[f(wk,i\u22121)\u2212 \u03b7] (78)\nand, using (74) and (78), the regularization parameter in (71) can instead be approximated as:\n\u03b3oi = max\n{\n0,\n\u2211N k=1 \u00b5k[f(wk,i\u22121)\u2212 \u03b7] \u2211N k=1 \u00b5 2 k\u2016\u2202f(wk,i\u22121)\u20162\n}\n(79)\nRemark 3: The update (79) still depends on data coming from all nodes in the network.

The performance\nof the sparse diffusion strategy depends on how close the upper bound \u03b7 is to the right value. In the simulation section, we will check the robustness of the regularized diffusion algorithm to misspecified values of \u03b7."}, {"heading": "IV. SIMULATION RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the sparse diffusion algorithm. In the first example, we compare the performance of the sparse diffusion strategy with respect to standard diffusion, considering fixed values of the regularization parameter \u03b3. The second example shows the benefits of adapting the sparsity parameter according to (80).\nNumerical Example 1 : Performance : We consider a connected network composed of 20 nodes. The topology of the network is shown in Fig. 1. The regressors uk,i have size M = 50 and are zero-mean white Gaussian distributed with covariance matrices Ru,k = \u03c32u,kIM , with \u03c3 2 u,k shown on the top right side of Fig. 1. The background white noise power \u03c32u,k of each node is depicted on the bottom right side of Fig. 1. The first example aims to show the tracking and steady-state performance for the sparse diffusion algorithm. In Fig. 2, we report the learning curves in terms of network MSD for 6 different adaptive filters: ATC diffusion LMS [8], ZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (25) and RZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (28), and the non-cooperative approach from [34]. The simulations use a value of \u00b5 = 0.1 and\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n20\nthe results are averaged over 100 independent experiments. The sparsity parameters are set to \u03b3 = 5\u00d710\u22123 for ZA-LMS, \u03b3 = 0.7\u00d7 10\u22123 for RZA-LMS, \u03b3ZA = 10\u22123 for ZA-ATC, \u03b3RZA = 0.25\u00d7 10\u22123 for RZAATC, and \u03b5 = 0.1. In this simulation, we consider diffusion algorithms without measurement exchange, i.e., C = I , and a combination matrix A that simply averages the estimates from the neighborhood such that al,k = 1/|Nk| for all l. Initially, only one of the 50 elements of wo is set equal to one while the others are equal to zero, making the system very sparse. After 1000 iterations, 25 elements are randomly selected and set equal to 1, making the system have a sparsity ratio of 25/50. After 2000 iterations,\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n21\nall the elements are set equal to 1, leaving a completely non-sparse system. As we see from Fig. 2, when the system is very sparse both ZA-ATC and RZA-ATC yield better steady-state performance than standard diffusion. The RZA-ATC outperforms ZA-ATC thanks to reweighted regularization. When the vector wo is only half sparse, the performance of ZA-ATC deteriorates, performing worse than standard diffusion, while RZA-ATC has the best performance among the three diffusion filters. When the system is completely non-sparse, the RZA-ATC still performs comparably to the standard diffusion filter. We also notice the gain of diffusion schemes with respect to the non-cooperative approaches from [34].\nThe theoretical derivations in Section III showed that it is possible to select the regularization parameter \u03b3 in order to have dominance in terms of MSD of the ATC-SD filter with respect to the unregularized diffusion algorithm. To quantify the effect of the sparsity parameter \u03b3 on the performance of the ATC-SD filters with respect to different degrees of system sparsity, we consider two additional examples. In Fig. 3 (left), we show the behavior of the difference (in dB) between the network MSD of ATC-ZA and standard diffusion versus \u03b3, for different sparsity degrees of wo. We consider the same settings of the previous simulation and the results are averaged over 100 independent experiments and over 100 samples after convergence. As we can see from Fig. 3 (left), reducing the sparsity of wo, the interval of \u03b3 values that yields a gain for ATC-ZA with respect to standard diffusion becomes smaller, until it reduces to zero when the system is not sparse enough. Different update functions may affect differently the steady-state performance of the ATC-SD algorithm. Thus, in Fig. 3 (right), we repeat the same experiment considering the ATC-RZA algorithm. As we can see, thanks to the reweighted regularization in (28), ATC-RZA gives better performance than ZA-ATC and yields a performance loss with respect to standard diffusion, for\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n22\nany \u03b3, only when the vector wo is completely non-sparse.\nFinally, we compare our proposed sparse diffusion schemes with the sparsity promoting adaptive algorithms for distributed learning recently proposed in [43] and in [44]. At the best of our knowledge, the works in [43] and [44] are the only two present in the literature that exploit sparsity processing data both in an adaptive and distributed fashion. In Fig. 4 (left), we compare the steady-state performance, averaged over 100 independent simulations, of five adaptive filters: ATC diffusion LMS [8], ZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (25), RZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (28), the ATC \u21131-LMS and the ATC \u21131-RWLMS algorithms from [44]. We consider a vector parameter wo with only 5 elements set equal to one, which have been randomly chosen, leading to a sparsity ratio of 5/50. The sparsity parameters are set to \u03b3ZA = 10\u22123 for ZA-ATC, \u03b3RZA = 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 for RZA-ATC, and \u03b5 = 0.1, for both our methods and the algorithms from [44]. The other settings are the same of the previous simulation, except that in this simulation the combination coefficients in (21) are chosen as cl,k = 1/|Nk| for all l, thus leading to ZA-ATC and RZA-ATC diffusion algorithms with measurement exchange. As we can notice from Fig. 4 (left), the proposed methods outperform the algorithms from [44] in terms of steady-state MSD. In Fig. 4 (right), we compare the transient network MSD of four adaptive filters: ATC diffusion LMS [8], ZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (25), RZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (28), and the projection based sparse learning from [43]. The settings of the ZA-ATC and\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n23\nRZA-ATC diffusion algorithms are the same of the previous simulation, whereas the parameters of the algorithm from [43] are chosen in order to have similar steady-state MSD with respect to the RZA-ATC diffusion method. Using the same notation adopted in [43], the parameters of the projection based filter are: \u03b5 = 1.3 \u00d7maxk(\u03c3v,k); \u00b5n = 0.06 \u00d7Mn; the radius of the weighted \u21131 ball is equal to \u2016wo\u20160 = 5 (i.e., the correct sparsity level); \u03b5\u0303n = 0.02; \u03b1 = 0.99 for i < 300 and \u03b1 = 0.8 for i > 300; the number of hyperslabs used per time update equals to q = 10. From Fig. 4 (right), it is possible to notice how the projected based method has a larger convergence rate with respect to the RZA ATC diffusion method. This positive feature is paid in terms of computational complexity. Indeed, while our methods have an LMS type complexity O(3M), the projection-based method from [43] has a complexity equal to O(M(3 + q + logM)), due to the presence of q projections onto the hyperslabs and 1 projection on the weighted \u21131 ball per iteration.\nNumerical Example 2 - Adaptation of the Regularization Parameter: In this example, we consider the same network shown in Fig. 1 and the same setting of the previous simulation for the regression data and additive noise. The first example aims to show the tracking and steady-state performance of the ATC-SD algorithm with adaptive regularization. In Fig. 5 (left), we report the learning curves in terms of network MSD for 3 different adaptive filters: ATC diffusion LMS [8], ZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (25)) and RZA-ATC diffusion described by (21) and (28), when the regularization parameter \u03b3i is chosen locally at each node according to the adaptive rule (80). The simulations use a value of \u00b5 = 0.1 and the results are averaged over 100 independent experiments. The approximation parameter for RZA-ATC diffusion in (28) is chosen equal to \u03b5 = 0.1. Initially, only one of the 50 elements of wo is set equal to one while the others are equal to zero, making the system very sparse. After 1000 iterations, 5 elements are randomly selected and set equal to 1, making the system have a sparsity ratio of 5/50. After 2000 iterations, all the elements are set equal to 1, leaving a completely non-sparse system. The upper bound \u03b7 in (77), used to evaluate the sparsity parameter in (80), is set to \u03b7 = \u2016wo\u20161 and varies in time according to the different choices of wo. As we can see from Fig. 5 (left), when the system is very sparse both ZA-ATC and RZA-ATC yield better steady-state performance than standard diffusion. The RZA-ATC outperforms ZA-ATC thanks to the reweighted regularization. When the vector wo is less sparse, the performance of ZA-ATC deteriorates, getting closer to standard diffusion, while RZA-ATC still guarantees a large gain. When the system is completely non-sparse, the three filters have the same performance. To see the effect of different sparsity ratios of the vector wo on the choice of the regularization, in Fig. 5 (right) we show the average behavior of the parameter \u03b3oi evaluated according to (80), for ZA-ATC diffusion and RZA-ATC diffusion, averaged across nodes over 100 independent realizations. As we can see, the system\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n24\nreacts to different sparsity ratios of the vector wo, adjusting accordingly the regularization parameter \u03b3oi in order to improve the performance of the ATC-SD strategy with respect to the unregularized algorithm. From Fig. 5 (right), it is interesting to note how the regularization parameter converges close to the minimum of the Differential MSD plotted in Fig. 3 for both ZA-ATC and RZA-ATC. In particular, \u03b3oi is forced to zero when the vector wo is totally non-sparse, leading to the same performance of the standard\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n25\ndiffusion algorithm.\nSince the adaptive update of the sparsity parameter \u03b3oi in (80) depends on the selection of the trigger \u03b7, which depends on some available prior knowledge on the sparsity level of wo, it is important to check the sensitivity of the ATC-SD algorithm to misspecified values of \u03b7. Thus, in Fig. 6, we report the average behavior of the MSD, for ZA-ATC diffusion and RZA-ATC diffusion, versus a percentual error on the specification of the true trigger value \u03b7. The settings are the same of the previous simulation and the results are averaged over 100 independent experiments and over 100 samples after convergence. We consider a vector parameter wo with only 5 elements set equal to one, which have been randomly chosen, leading to a sparsity ratio of 5/50. In this case, the true value for the trigger parameter \u03b7 would be equal to \u2016wo\u20161 = 5. The regularization parameter \u03b3i is chosen locally at each node according to the adaptive rule (80). As we can notice from Fig. 6, the ZA-ATC diffusion algorithm is very sensitive to misspecified values of \u03b7, especially in the case of under-estimation of the trigger parameter. Indeed, by under-estimating the value of \u03b7, the system would try to increase the sparsity parameter \u03b3i, in order to make the solution more sparse. Thus, as we notice from Fig. 6, being the true vector wo not sparse enough with respect to the selection of the trigger \u03b7, the system determines an increment of the bias that strongly affects the performance. On the contrary, from Fig. 6, we notice how the RZA-ATC diffusion algorithm is robust to errors in the selection of the trigger parameter \u03b7. This benefit is again due to regularization, whose presence reduces the magnitude of the bias, improving the estimation capabilities of the algorithm and relaxing the choice of the system parameters."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we proposed a class of diffusion LMS strategies, regularized by convex sparsifying penalties, for distributed estimation over adaptive networks. Two different penalty functions have been employed: the \u21131-norm, which uniformly attracts to zero all the vector elements, and a reweighted function, which better approximates the \u21130-norm, selectively shrinking only the elements with small magnitude. Convergence and mean-square analysis of the sparse adaptive diffusion filter show under what conditions we have dominance of the proposed method with respect to its unregularized counterpart in terms of steady-state performance. Further analysis leads to a procedure to update the regularization parameter of the algorithm, in order to ensure dominance of the sparse diffusion filter with respect to its unregularized version. In this way, the network can adjust in real-time the system parameters to improve the estimation performance, according to the sparsity of the underlying vector. Several numerical results show the potential benefits of using such strategies.\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n26"}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A", "text": "PROOF OF THEOREM 1\nLetting B = AT (I \u2212MD) and bi = \u03b3ATM\u00b7 E\u2202f(wi\u22121), recursion (39) gives\nEw\u0303i = BiEw\u03030 + i\u22121 \u2211\nn=0\nBnbi\u2212n (82)\nwhere Ew\u03030 is the initial condition. As long as we can show that both terms on the right hand side of (82) converge as i goes to infinity, then we would be able to conclude the convergence of Ew\u0303i. To proceed, we call upon results from [10], [11], [9]. Let z = col{z1, z2, . . . , zN} denote a vector that is obtained by stacking N subvectors of size M \u00d7 1 each (as is the case with w\u0303i). The block maximum norm of z is defined as\n\u2016z\u2016b,\u221e = max 1\u2264k\u2264N \u2016zk\u2016, (83)\nwhere \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 denotes the Euclidean norm of its vector argument. Likewise, the induced block maximum norm of a block matrix X with M \u00d7M block entries is defined as:\n\u2016X\u2016b,\u221e = max z 6=0 \u2016X z\u2016b,\u221e \u2016z\u2016b,\u221e . (84)\nIt is easy to check that the first term on the RHS of (82) converges to zero as i \u2192 \u221e. Indeed, note that\n\u2016BiEw\u03030\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u2016B\u2016ib,\u221e \u00b7 \u2016Ew\u03030\u2016b,\u221e \u2192 0 (85)\nif we can ensure that \u2016B\u2016b,\u221e < 1. This condition is actually satisfied by (40). To see this, we invoke the triangle inequality of norms to note that\n\u2016B\u2016b,\u221e = \u2225 \u2225AT (I \u2212MD) \u2225 \u2225 b,\u221e \u2264 \u2225 \u2225AT \u2225 \u2225 b,\u221e \u00b7 \u2016I \u2212MD\u2016b,\u221e = \u2016I \u2212MD\u2016b,\u221e (86)\nsince \u2225 \u2225AT \u2225 \u2225\nb,\u221e = 1 in view of the fact that A is a left-stochastic matrix [10]. Therefore, to satisfy\n\u2016B\u2016b,\u221e < 1, it suffices to require \u2016I \u2212MD\u2016b,\u221e < 1. (87)\nNow, we recall a result from [11], [48] on the block maximum norm of a block diagonal and Hermitian matrix X with M \u00d7M blocks {Xk}, which states that\n\u2016X\u2016b,\u221e = max k=1,...,N \u03c1(Xk) (88)\nThus, since M is diagonal, condition (87) will hold if the matrix I \u2212MD is stable. Using (38), we can easily verify that this condition is satisfied for any step-sizes satisfying (40), as claimed before. Therefore, when the step-sizes satisfy condition (40), the first term on the RHS of (82) will converge to zero. We\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n27\nwill show next that condition (40) also implies that the second term on the RHS of (82) asymptotically converges to a finite value, thus leading to the overall convergence of the recursion (82).\nOne effective tool to prove convergence of a series is the comparison test [51, p. 14]: a series is absolutely convergent if each term of the series can be bounded by a term of an absolutely convergent series. Thus, denoting by [x]k the k-th entry of a vector x, it suffices to show that the series \u221e \u2211\nn=0\n[Bnbi\u2212n]k (89)\nconverges for each k = 1, . . . , NM . Now, each term of the series in (89) can be bounded as:\n[Bnbi\u2212n]k \u2264 |[Bnbi\u2212n]k| \u2264 \u2016Bnbi\u2212n\u2016b,\u221e \u2264 \u2016B\u2016nb,\u221e \u00b7 \u2016bi\u2212n\u2016b,\u221e \u2264 \u03b4n \u00b7 bmax (90)\nwhere \u03b4 = \u2016B\u2016b,\u221e and\nbmax = max j\n\u2016\u03b3ATM \u00b7 E\u2202f(wj\u22121)\u2016b,\u221e (91)\nThe second inequality in (90) holds because the block maximum norm of a vector is greater than or equal to the largest absolute value of its entries. The scalar bmax is finite for the following reason. First, note that the subgradient vector \u2202f(wi\u22121) has bounded entries. In particular, \u2202fmax \u2264 \u221a M for the ZA update in (25), and \u2202fmax \u2264 \u221a M/\u03b5 for the RZA update in (28).

In summary, since both first and second term on the RHS of (82) asymptotically converge to finite values, we conclude that Ew\u0303i will converge to a steady-state value.

The term \u03b1\u03a3,i in (49) can be written as EcTi\u22121w\u0303i\u22121 where the vector\nci\u22121 , \u22122 (I \u2212MD)T A\u03a3ATM\u2202f(wi\u22121) (98)\nis again bounded for all i.

As shown in Appendix A, the evolution of Ew\u0303i\u22121 is given by (82), which, for any finite initialization vector w\u03030, converges as i \u2192 \u221e and cannot diverge for all i, if the step-sizes are chosen to satisfy (40). Consequently, |Ew\u0303i\u22121| can be upper bounded by some positive constant vector p2 for all i. Thus, letting r = vec(ATMGTMA), expression (53) can be upper bounded as\nE\u2016w\u0303i\u20162\u03c3 \u2264 E\u2016w\u0303i\u22121\u20162F\u03c3 + rT\u03c3 + p3 (100)\nwhere p3 = \u03b32p1 + \u03b3cmax1T p2 > 0. The positive constant p3 can be related to the quantity rT\u03c3 through some constant \u03c5 \u2208 R+, say, p3 = \u03c5rT\u03c3. Relation (100) is an inequality, which can be used to prove convergence of the sequence E\u2016w\u0303i\u20162\u03c3 to a bounded region instead of a fixed point. Alternatively, we convert (100) into an equality recursion as follows:\nE\u2016w\u0303i\u20162\u03c3 = \u03b8iE\u2016w\u0303i\u22121\u20162F\u03c3 + \u03b8i(1 + \u03c5)rT\u03c3 (101)\nfor some coefficient \u03b8i \u2208 [0, 1] that depends on both E\u2016w\u0303i\u20162\u03c3 and E\u2016w\u0303i\u22121\u20162F\u03c3 . Recursion (101) leads to:\nE\u2016w\u0303i\u20162\u03c3 = [ i \u220f\nl=1\n\u03b8l\n]\nE\u2016w\u03030\u20162F i\u03c3 + (1 + \u03c5)rT i\u22121 \u2211\nl=0\n[\ni \u220f\nn=i\u2212l\n\u03b8n\n]\nF l\u03c3 (102)\nwhere E\u2016w\u03030\u20162 is the initial condition. We first note that if F is stable, F i \u2192 0 as i \u2192 \u221e. In this way, the first term on the RHS of (102) vanishes asymptotically. Now, proceeding as in Appendix A, we can use the comparison test [51, p. 14] to prove that, if F is a stable matrix, the second term on the RHS\nNovember 14, 2012 DRAFT\n29\nof (102) is an absolutely convergent series. Thus, denoting again by [x]k the k-th entry of a vector x, it suffices to show the convergence of the series: \u221e \u2211\nl=0\n[ \u03bel(i)F l\u03c3 ]\nk (103)\nwith \u03bel(i) = \u220fi n=i\u2212l \u03b8n, for k = 1, . . . , NM . Each term of the series in (103) can be bounded as:\n[ \u03bel(i)F l\u03c3 ]\nk \u2264\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 [ \u03bel(i)F l\u03c3 ]\nk\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2264 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 [ F l\u03c3 ]\nk\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2264 \u2016F l\u03c3\u2016b,\u221e \u2264 \u2016F l\u2016b,\u221e\u2016\u03c3\u2016b,\u221e (104)\nwhere the second inequality in (104) holds because the coefficients \u03bel(i) \u2208 [0, 1] for all i, whereas the third inequality in (104) holds because the block maximum norm of a vector is greater equal than the largest absolute value of its entries. A known result in matrix theory [49, p. 30] states that for every square stable matrix F , and every \u01eb > 0, there exists a submultiplicative matrix norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u03c1 such that\n\u2016F\u2016\u03c1 = \u03c1(F) + \u01eb (105)\nSince F is stable, \u03c1(F) < 1, we can choose \u01eb > 0 such that \u03c1(F) + \u01eb = \u03be < 1. Now, since in a finite dimensional space all norms are equivalent [50], we have \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016b,\u221e \u2264 \u03b6 \u00b7 \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u03c1, for some positive constant \u03b6 . Thus, we have\n\u2016F l\u2016b,\u221e \u2264 \u03b6 \u00b7 \u2016F l\u2016\u03c1 \u2264 \u03b6 \u00b7 \u2016F\u2016l\u03c1 = \u03b6 \u00b7 \u03bel (106)\nand, substituting (106) into (104), we get \u221e \u2211\nl=0\n\u2016F l\u2016b,\u221e \u00b7 \u2016\u03c3\u2016b,\u221e \u2264 \u03b6 \u00b7 \u2016\u03c3\u2016b,\u221e \u00b7 \u221e \u2211\nl=0\n\u03bel = \u03b6 \u00b7 \u2016\u03c3\u2016b,\u221e\n1\u2212 \u03be (107)\nwhich means that the series (107) and, consequently, the series (103), are absolutely convergent. In summary, since both the first and second terms on the RHS of (102) asymptotically converge to finite values, we conclude that E\u2016w\u0303i\u20162\u03c3 will converge to a steady-state value, thus completing our proof."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX C", "text": "EXISTENCE OF \u03b1\u03a3,\u221e\nLet us consider the bounded random vector ci in (98), which is independent of the noise sequence\nvk(i) for all k, i.

article proposes diffusion LMS strategies for distributed estimation over adaptive networks that are able to exploit sparsity in the underlying system model. The approach relies on convex regularization, common in compressive sensing, to enhance the detection of sparsity via a diffusive process over the network. The resulting algorithms endow networks with learning abilities and allow them to learn the sparse structure from the incoming data in real-time, and also to track variations in the sparsity of the model. We provide convergence and mean-square performance analysis of the proposed method and show under what conditions it outperforms the unregularized diffusion version. We also show how to adaptively select the regularization parameter. Simulation results illustrate the advantage of the proposed filters for sparse data recovery.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
