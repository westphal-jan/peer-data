INTRODUCTION", "text": "Much research in recent years has focused on constructing semi-automatic and automatic aligned data resources, which are essential for many Natural Language Processing Tasks; however for some pairs of languages there is still a huge lack of annotated data.\nManual construction of Parallel corpus requires high quality translators, besides It is time consuming and expensive. With the proliferation of the internet and the immense amount of data, a number of researchers have proposed using the World Wide Web as a large-scale corpus[5]. However due to redundancy and ambiguous information on the web, we must find methods of extracting only the information that is useful for a given task. [4].\nExtracting parallel sentences from a comparable corpus is a challenging task, due to the fact that despite two documents can be referred to a same topic, it can be possible that both documents do not have a single sentence in common.\nIn this study, we propose an approach for extracting Japanese-Spanish parallel sentences from Wikipedia using Part-of-Speech rule based alignment and Dictionary based translation. We use as comparable corpora to Wikipedia articles, a dictionary extracted from the Wikipedia links and Aulex a free Japanese-Spanish dictionary"}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORKS", "text": "The use of Wikipedia as a data resource in NLP is fairly new, and thus research is fairly limited. There are, however, works showing promising results.[2] attempts to extract the named entities from Wikipedia and presents two disambiguation methods using cosine similarity and SVM.\nFirstly detecting a named entity from Wikipedia by using IE technique, and disambiguates between multiples entities, using context articles similarity by using cosine similarity and of taxonomy kernel.\nSuch work that is directly related to this research is [1] . Their research uses two approaches to similarity between sentences in Wikipedia. Firstly they introduced an MT based approach, using Jaccard Similarity and \u2018Babel MT system of Altavista1\u2019 to aligned the sentences. The second approach, the Link based bilingual lexicon, that used the hyperlinks in every sentences by mean of a dictionary extracted from Wikipedia to select the. Their result showed best result on using the second approach, especially in articles that are literal translation on each other.\nOur approach differs in that we convert the articles in their equivalent POS tags and we just align sentences that are according to the rules we add. And then we used two Japanese- Spanish dictionaries as a seed lexicon."}, {"heading": "3. BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Comparable Corpora2", "text": "A comparable corpus is a collection of text about a given topic in two or more languages. For example, The \u2018Yomiuri Shimbun3 corpora\u2019, a corpus extracted from their daily news both in English and Japanese. Despite the news in both languages are the same, they do not make a proper translation of the content.\nComparable corpora are used for many NLP tasks, such as: Information Retrieval, Machine Translation, bilingual lexicon extraction, and so on. In languages with a scarcity of resources Comparable corpora are an alternative of prime order in NLP research."}, {"heading": "3.2. Wikipedia", "text": "Wikipedia4 is a multilingual web-based encyclopedia with articles on a wide range of topics, in which the texts are aligned across different languages.\nWikipedia is the successor of Nupedia- an online encyclopedia written by experts in different fields that does not exist now. Wikipedia arose as a single language project (English) on January, 2001 to support Wikipedia differs from Nupedia mainly that anyone can write it, and writers do not need to be an expert in the field that is written.\n1 Babel, is an online multilingual translation system 2 Corpora is a plural of corpus. 3 \u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e: is a Japanese newspaper, with an English version too. http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/ 4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\nWikipedia is written collaboratively by volunteers (called \u201cwikipedians\u201d) from different places all around the world. This is because Wikipedia has volunteers from many nationalities who write in many different languages. Actually it has articles written in more than 200 languages, with different numbers of articles in each language.\nThe topics vary from science, covering many different fields such as informatics, biology, anthropology and entertainment, such as albums name, artist, actors etc. and fictional characters such as James Bond.\nWikipedia is not only a simple encyclopaedia; it has some features that make Wikipedia suitable for NLP research. These features are:"}, {"heading": "3.2.1. Redirect pages", "text": "The redirect page is a very suitable resource for eliminating redundant articles. This means avoiding the existence of two articles referring to the same topic.\nThis is used in the case of:\n\u2022 Synonyms like \u2018altruism\u2019 which redirects to \u2018selflessness\u2019 \u2022 Abreviations like \u2018USA\u2019 redirects to \u2018The United States of America\u2019 \u2022 Variation in Spelling like \u2018colour\u2019 which redirects to \u2018color\u2019 \u2022 Nicknames and pseudonyms like \u2018Einstein\u2019 which redirects to \u2018Albert Einstein\u2019"}, {"heading": "3.2.2.

These pages have titles that start with \u201cCategory:\u201d and is followed by the name of the particular category.\nCategorization is a project of Wikipedia that attempts to assign to each article a category. The category is assigned manually by wikipedians and therefore not all pages have a category item.\nSome articles belong to multiple categories. For example the article \u201cDominican Republic\u201d belongs to three categories such as: \u201cDominican Republic\u201d, \u201cIsland countries\u201d and \u201cSpanishspeaking countries\u201d.

General Description", "text": "Figure 1 shows a general view of the methodology. First we extract from Wikipedia all the aligned links i.e. Wikipedia article titles. We extract the Japanese and Spanish about the same topic. Then eliminate the unnecessary data (pre-processing). Split into sentences. After extracting those articles, Use a POS tagger to add the lexical category to each word in a given sentence. Choose the sentences that match according to their lexical category.

Dictionary Extraction from Wikipedia", "text": "The goal of this phase is acquisition of Japanese-Spanish-English tuples of the Wikipedia\u2019s article titles in order to acquire translations. Wikipedia provides links in each article to corresponding articles in different languages.\nEvery article page in Wikipedia has on the left hand side some boxes labelled: \u2018navigation\u2019, \u2018search\u2019, \u2018toolbox\u2019 and at finally \u2018in other languages\u2019. This has a list of all the languages available for that article, although the article in each language does not all have exactly the same contents. In most cases English articles are longer or have more information than the same article in other languages, because most of the Wikipedia collaborators are native English speakers."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Methodology", "text": "Take all articles titles that are nouns or named entities and look in the articles\u2019 contents for the box called \u2018In other languages\u2019. Verify that it has at least one link. If the box exists it redirects to the same article in other languages. Extract the words in these other languages and align it with the original article title. For instance the Spanish article titled \u2018econom\u00eda\u2019 (economics), is translated into Japanese as \u2018keizaigaku\u2019 (\u7d4c\u6e08\u5b66). When we click Spanish or Japanese in the other languages box we obtain an article about the same topic in the other language, this gives us the translation."}, {"heading": "4.3.

Spliting into Sentences and POS tagging", "text": "For splitting the sentences in the Spanish articles we used NLTK toolkit5 , which is a well-known platform for building Python scripts.\nFor tag Spanish sentences, we used FreeLing6, which an open source suit for language analizer, specialized in Spanish language.\n5 http://nltk.org/ 6 http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/\nFor Splitting into sentences, in to words and add a word category, we used MeCab7, which is a Part-of-Speech and Morphological Analyser for Japanese."}, {"heading": "4.6. Constructing the Rules", "text": "Japanese is a Subject-Object-Verb language; While Spanish is a Subject-Verb-Object language.\nFigure 2 shows the basic order of the sentences both in Japanese and Spanish, using as a example the sentence \u201cThe dog drinks water\u201d. The Japanese sentence \u2018\u72ac\u306f\u6c34\u3092\u306e\u307f\u307e\u3059\u2019 (Inu wa mizu wo nomimasu.)\u2018 The dog drinks water\u2019 is translated into Spanish as \u2018El perro bebe agua\u2019.\ntable 1 shows some of the rules applied to this work.

Experimental Evaluation", "text": "For the evaluation of the proposed method, we took a sample of 20 random Japanese and Spanish articles. This experiments were based on two approaches: the hyperlink approach [1] as a baseline and the Rule-Based approach. We downloaded the Wikipedia xml data for April 20128.\nWe used the Aulex9 dictionary because the dictionary extracted from Wikipedia contain mostly noums and name entitities. To align other grammatical forms such as: verbs, adjectives, etc. we require another dictionary.\nTable 2 shows the result obtained both with the baseline [1] and our approach. In column 1 shows the \u201cCorrect identification\u201d means the sentences with the high scores and the alignment were correct. \u201cPartial Matching\u201d refers to the sentences both in source and target language with a noum phrase in comun. And at last \u201cIncorrect Identification\u201d, refers to sentences with the higher scored. However, there was not even one word match"}, {"heading": "5.2. Discussion", "text": "We noticed that in the sentences form the first part of the article. It is usually the definition of the title of the article, have more correct identification, both approaches. Overall Rule-Based approach performed better than the baseline. This is because when in a given sentence, if the hyperlink word is or the title of the article is repeated, give automatically the best score, even if It is redundant.\nSome identification performed no as well as we expected due to we need to add more rules, It can be manually or by using bootstrapping methods, this is very interesting point for a future work. We have noticed that by using this method It is possible the construction of new sentences, even they are not in both articles."}, {"heading": "6.
