Two of the algorithms improve on the running times of algorithms by Robertson and Seymour, and Becker and Geiger that approximate the op\u00ad timum by factors of 4 and 3\ufffd, respectively. A third algorithm is faster than those but gives an approximation factor of 4\ufffd. The last algorithm is yet faster, producing factor-0( lgk) approxi\u00ad mations in polynomial time. Finding triangula\u00ad tions of minimum treewidth for graphs is central to many problems in computer science. Real\u00ad world problems in artificial intelligence, VLSI design and databases are efficiently solvable if we have an efficient approximation algorithm for them. We report on experimental results confirm\u00ad ing the effectiveness of our algorithms for large graphs associated with real-world problems.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
