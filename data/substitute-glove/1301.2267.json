We fo\u00ad cus on the forward selection procedure, but we also discuss how backward selection and the combination of the two can be performed efficiently. The main contributions of this paper are (1) a simple characterization for the edges that can be added to a decompos\u00ad able model while retaining its decomposabil\u00ad ity and (2) an efficient algorithm for enumer\u00ad ating all such edges for a given decomposable model in O(n2) time, where n is the number of variables in the model. We also analyze the complexity of the overall stepwise selection procedure (which includes the complexity of enumerating eligible edges as well as the complexity of deciding how to \"progress\"). We use the KL divergence of the model from the saturated model as our metric, but the results we present here extend to many other metrics as well.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
