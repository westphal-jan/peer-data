Both axiom\u00ad tizations are inspired by von Neumann and Morgenstern's system of axioms for the case of probability theory. We show that our ap\u00ad proach naturally unifies two axiomatic sys\u00ad tems that correspond, respectively, to pes\u00ad simistic and optimistic decision criteria pro\u00ad posed by Dubois et al. The simplifying uni\u00ad fication is achieved by (i) replacing axioms that are supposed to reflect two informational attitudes (uncertainty aversion and uncer\u00ad tainty attraction) by an axiom that imposes order on set of standard lotteries, and ( ii) us\u00ad ing a binary utility scale in which each utility level is represented by a pair of numbers.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
