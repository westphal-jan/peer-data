Frequently this difficulty can be alleviated by the availability of problem-specific knowledge. For example, it may be relatively easy to design controllers that are good locally, though having no global guarantees. We propose a non paramet\u00ad ric method to combine these local controllers to obtain globally good solutions. We apply this formulation to two types of problems: motion planning (stochastic shortest path problems) and discounted-cost MDPs. For motion planning, we argue that only considering the expected cost of a path may be overly simplistic in the presence of uncertainty. We propose an alternative: find\u00ad ing the minimum cost path, subject to the con\u00ad straint that the robot must reach the goal with high probability. For this problem, we prove that a polynomial number of samples is sufficient to obtain a high probability path. For discounted MDPs, we consider various problem formulations that explicitly deal with model uncertainty. We provide empirical evidence of the usefulness of these approaches using the control of a robot arm.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
