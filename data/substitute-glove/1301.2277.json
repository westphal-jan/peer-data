The problem is best de\u00ad scribed in terms of future buy and sell contracts. By buying less reliable, but less expensive, buy (supply) contracts, a company or a trader can cover a position of more reliable and more expen\u00ad sive sell contracts. The goal is to maximize the expected net gain (profit) by constructing a close to optimum portfolio out of the available buy and sell contracts. This stochastic planning problem can be formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear programm ing problem with recourse. However, this formalization leads to solutions that are ex\u00ad ponential in the number of possible failure com\u00ad binations. Thus, this approach is not feasible for large scale problems. In this work we investi\u00ad gate heuristic approximation techniques alleviat\u00ad ing the efficiency problem. We primarily focus on the clustering approach and devise heuristics for finding clusterings leading to good approxi\u00ad mations. We illustrate the quality and feasibility of the approach through experimental data.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
