An important sub\u00ad class of hybrid BNs are conditional linear Gaussian (CLG) networks, where the conditional distribution of the continuous variables given an assignment to the discrete variables is a multivariate Gaussian. Lau\u00ad ritzen's extension to the clique tree algorithm can be used for exact inference in CLG networks. However, many domains include discrete variables that depend on continuous ones, and CLG networks do not allow such dependencies to be represented. In this paper, we propose the first \"exact\" inference algorithm for aug\u00ad mented CLG networks CLG networks augmented by allowing discrete children of continuous parents. Our algorithm is based on Lauritzen's algorithm, and is exact in a similar sense: it computes the exact dis\u00ad tributions over the discrete nodes, and the exact first and second moments of the continuous ones, up to in\u00ad accuracies resulting from numerical integration used within the algorithm. In the special case of softmax CPDs, we show that integration can often be done effi\u00ad ciently, and that using the first two moments leads to a particularly accurate approximation. We show empiri\u00ad cally that our algorithm achieves substantially higher accuracy at lower cost than previous algorithms for this task.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
