The input to the MLP is a vector of the states of the eviden\u00ad tial nodes. The activity of an output unit is interpreted as a prediction of the posterior marginal of the corresponding variable. The MLP is trained using samples generated from the corresponding Bayesian network. We evaluate a recognition network that was trained to do inference in a large Bayesian network, similar in structure and complex\u00ad ity to the Quick Medical Reference, Decision Theoretic (QMR-DT) network. Our network is a binary, two-layer, noisy-OR (BN20) net\u00ad work containing over 4000 potentially observ\u00ad able nodes and over 600 unobservable, hidden nodes. In real medical diagnosis, most ob\u00ad servables are unavailable, and there is a com\u00ad plex and unknown process that selects which ones are provided. We incorporate a very ba\u00ad sic type of selection bias in our network: a known preference that available observables are positive rather than negative. Even this simple bias has a significant effect on the pos\u00ad terior. We compare the performance of our recogni\u00ad tion network to state-of-the-art approximate inference algorithms on a large set of test cases. In order to evaluate the effect of our simplistic model of the selection bias, we eval\u00ad uate algorithms using a variety of incorrectly modelled selection biases. Recognition net\u00ad works perform well using both correct and incorrect selection biases. \u2022 also affiliated with Department of Brain and Cogni\u00ad tive Sciences at MIT", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
