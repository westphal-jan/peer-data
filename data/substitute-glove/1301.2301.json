Normally the full joint distribution over the conditioning variables is required to determine the probability of the conditioned variable. Under what circumstances are the marginal distributions over the conditioning variables sufficient to determine the probabil\u00ad ity of the conditioned variable? Sufficiency in this sense is equivalent to additive separa\u00ad bility of the conditional probability distribu\u00ad tion. Such separability structure is natural and can be exploited for efficient inference. Separability has a natural generalization to conditional separability. Separability provides a precise notion of hi\u00ad erarchical decomposition in temporal prob\u00ad abilistic models. Given a system that is decomposed into separable subsystems, ex\u00ad act marginal probabilities over subsystems at future points in time can be computed by propagating marginal subsystem probabil\u00ad ities, rather than complete system joint prob\u00ad abilities. Thus, separability can make exact prediction tractable. However, observations can break separability, so exact monitoring of dynamic systems remains hard.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
