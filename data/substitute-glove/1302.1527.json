In particular, the method allows one to produce CPTs for nodes in\u00ad volved in the reversal that exploit regularities in the conditional distributions. We argue that this approach alleviates some of the overhead asso\u00ad ciated with arc reversal, plays an important role in evidence integration and can be used to re\u00ad strict sampling of variables in DPNs. We also provide an algorithm that detects the dynamic ir\u00ad relevance of state variables in forward simula\u00ad tion. This algorithm exploits the structured CPTs in a reversed network to determine, in a time\u00ad independent fashion, the conditions under which a variable does or does not need to be sampled.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
