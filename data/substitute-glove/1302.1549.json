PI models cannot be learned correctly by many algorithms that rely on a single link search. Earlier work on learning PI models has sug\u00ad gested a straightforward multi-link search al\u00ad gorithm. However, when a domain contains recursively embedded PI submodels, it may escape the detection of such an algorithm. In this paper, we propose an improved al\u00ad gorithm that ensures the learning of all em\u00ad bedded PI submodels whose sizes are upper bounded by a predetermined parameter. We show that this improved learning capability only increases the complexity slightly beyond that of the previous algorithm. The perfor\u00ad mance of the new algorithm is demonstrated through experiment.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
