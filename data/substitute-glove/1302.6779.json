K2 is a particular instantiation of the method that implements a greedy search strategy. To evaluate the accuracy of K2, we randomly generated a number of BNs and for each of those we simulated data sets. K2 was then used to induce the generating BNs from the simulated data. We examine the performance of the program, and the factors that influence it We also present a simple BN model, developed from our results, which predicts the accuracy of K2, when given various characteristics of the data set .", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
