Objective information is infor mation about me environment, whcrca\ufffd su\ufffdiective informa tion is infonnation about the state of the agent' s hcliefs. For example, we might characterize the infonnation of an agent travelling from San Francisco to New York as con\ufffdisting of the objective infonnation tlmt the weather is warm in San Francisco, and the subjective infotmation that the proba bility rhat the weather is wann in New York is 0.2.

The truth or falsity of these pieces of informa tion is not detcnnined by the state of the environment. Although subj ective infonnation could take many differ ent l(mns. we will concentrate here on degrees of belief These arc probabilities that are assigned to fonnulas ex pressing objective assertions. For example, the assertion \"the weather is warm in New York\" is an objective one: it is either true or false in the agent's environment. But when we <L..;sign a degree of belief to this assertion, as above, we obtain a subjective a\ufffdsertion: it becomes a statement about the state of the agent's beliefs. In tl1e context of probability theory the distinction between subjective and objective can appear somewhat subtle. because some form of objective information (such <L<; proportions or frequencies) obey the laws of probahility,j ust a<; do degrees of belief. Yet the dis tincrion can be a significant one if we want to use or interpret a pmbahilistic theory conectly. Camap's work [Car50] is notewort11y for its careful distinction between, and study of, both statistical probabilities, which are objective, and degree of belief probabilities, which are subjective. In order to understand this distinction, it is useful to pro vide a formal semantics for degrees of belief that captures the difference between them and objective information. As dcmonstraled by Halpern [Hal90], a natural, and very gen eral. way to give a semantics to degrees of belief is by defining a probability distribution over a set of possible worlds.1 The degree of belief in a fonnula r.p is then the probability of the set of worlds where r.p is true. In this framework we can characterize o\ufffdjective infonnation as consisting of assertions (expressed as fmmulas} that can he assigned a truth value by a single world. For example, in any given world Tweety the bird does or does not fly. Hence, the fonnula Fly(Tweety) is objective. Statistical assertions such as IIFly(x)IBird(J:)II'\" \ufffd 0.8, read \"approx imately 80% of birds fly\", are also objective. On the other hand, Pr( Fly(Tweety)) = 0.8, expressing the assertion that\n1Conceptually. this notion of world is just as in classical \u00b7\u00b7possibl\ufffd-worlds semantics\": a complete picture or description of tht! way the world might he. Formally, we take a world to be an intcrprctntion (model) for first-order logic.\n38 Bacchus, Grove, Halpern, and Koller\nthe agent's degree of belief in Tweety !lying is 0.8, is not objective, as its truth is determined by whether or not tlle probability of the set of worlds where Tweety flies is 0.8. Although we cannot easily characterize an agent's degrees of beliefs as being correct or incorrect, it is nevertlleless clear that these beliefs should have some relation to objec tive reality. One way of guaranteeing this is to actually generate them from the objective information available to the agent. Several ways of doing this have been consid ered in the literature; for example, [BGHK92, PV92] each discuss several possibilities. The approaches in {BGHK92) are based in a very natural way on tlle semantics described above. Assume we have a (prior) probability distribution over some set of worlds. We cru1 t11en generate degrees of belief from an objective knowledge ba\ufffde KB by u sing standard Bayesian conditioning: to t11e formula 'P we a\ufffd sign as its degree of belief the conditional probabi lity of r.p given KB. In [BGHK92] we considered three particu lar choices for a prior, and investigated the properties of the resulting inductive inference systems. In [BGHK93] we concentrated on the simplest of these methods-the random-worlds method-whose choice of prior is essen tially the uniform prior over the set of possible worlds.\nMore precisely, suppose we restrict our attention to worlds (i.e., interpretations of ru1 appropriate vocabulary for first order logic) with t11e domain { I, . . . , N}. Assuming we have a finite vocabulary, there will be only finitely many such worlds. Random worlds takes a'> the set of worlds all of these worlds, and uses perhaps the simplest probability distribution over them-the uniform distribution\ufffdthus as suming that each of t11e worlds is equally likely. This gives a prior distribution on the set of possible worlds. We can now induce a degree of belief in 'P given KB by using the conditional probability of 'P given Kll with respect to this uniform distribution. II is ea-;y to see that the degree of belief in r.p given KB is then simply tJ1e fraction of possible worlds satisfying KB that also satisfy 'P\u00b7 In general. how ever, we do not know the domain size N; we know only that it is typically large. We cm1 therefore approximate the degree of belief for the true but unknown N by computing the limiting value of this degree of be lief as N grows large. This limiting value (if it exists, which it may not) is denoted \ufffd( r.piKB), and it is what the random-world method takes to be the degree of belief in 'P given KB. In [BGHK93], we showed that U1is method possesses a number of anractive properties, such. as a preference for more specific infonna tion and the ability to ignore inelevant information.\nThe random-worlds method Clli1 generate degrees of be Iief from rich knowledge bases that may contain first-order. statistical , and default information. However, w; with any conditioning process, is limited to dealing with objective information. When we add subjective formulas to KB. we can no longer simply condition on KB: the conditioning process eliminates those worlds inconsistent with our infor mation, while U1e truth of a subjective formula cannot be determined by a single world.2 Hence, we would like to\n2In the context of random worlds (and in other cases where the degrees of belief are determined using a prior on the set of\nextend the nmdom-worlds method so as to enable it to deal with both objective and subjective information.\nWhy do we wrun to take into account subjective beliefs? There are a number of situations where this seems to make sense. For example, suppose a birdwatcher is interested in a domain of birds, m1d has an objective knowledge base KBbird consisting of t11e statistical inf ormation\nIICardinal(x)i-.Red(.1\ufffd)11x \ufffd 0.1 1\\ IICardina/(;t)IRed(x)llx \ufffd 0.7.\nNow the birdwatcher catches a glimpse of a bird b flying by that seems to be red. The birdwatcher is trying to decide if b is a cru\u00b7dinal. By the results of [BGHK93], if the birdwatcher assumes U1at U1e bird is not red, random-worlds gives Prr\ufffd(Cardinal(b)IKBbird 1\\ -.Red(b)) ::::: 0.1. On the other hand, if she assumes tlmt the bird is red, we get P\u2022J.:::(Conlinal(b)IKB,;,-rJ 1\\ Red( b))::::: 0.7. But it does not seem appropriate for her to do either; rather we would like to he able to generate a degree of belief in Cardinal( b) that takes into account the birdwatcher's degree of belief in Red( b). For example, if this degree of belief is 0.8, then we would like to use a knowledge ba<>e such as KBb;rd 1\\ Pr (Red(b) ) = O.R. It seems reasonable to expect that the resul t ing degree of oclief in Cardinal(b) would then be somewhere bet ween the two extremes of 0. 7 and 0.1. As another example, suppose we have reason to believe that two sensors are independent. For simplicity, suppose the sensors measure temperature, and report it to be either high, h. or low. I. We can imagine t11ree unary predicates: S/(.r), indicating that sensor 1 reports the value x; S2(x), a similar predicate for sensor 2; and Actual(x ), indicating that the actu al temperature is ;r:. That the sensors are inde pendent (given the actual value) can be represented by the conj unction over all choices for .r:, .1J, and J:11 in {I, h} of:\nPr(S/(:t') 1\\ S2(.r\")IActual(;r)) = Pr(Sl(:t')IActua/(;r)) x Pr(S2(x\")IActual(x)).\nIt could he that we have dctennined that ilie sensors are independent through the observation of a number of test readings. Such empirical evidence could be summarized by a statistical assertion \ufffdmd thus added to our knowledge base without requ iring a degree of belief statement like ilie above. However. this is not the normal situation. Rather, we arc more likely to have based our belief in independence on other information. such a'> our beliefs about causality. For example, the sensors may have been built by different manufacturers. In this ca\ufffde. it seems most reasonable to represent this kind of information using an assertion about degrees of belief.\nHow, then, can we incorporate information about degrees of belief into the random-worlds framework? More generally, given any inference proce,u3 -i.e., a method for generat ing degrees of belief from objective infonnation-we would\nworlds). this problem can be viewed as an instance of the general problem of conditioning a distribution on uncertain evidence.\n3The term \u00b7\u00b7inference process\" is taken hom Paris and Vencov sko I PVX91. Our framework is slightly different from theirs, but we think this usage of the term is consistent with their intent.\nlike to extend it so that it can also deal with subjective infor mation. This is an issue that has received some attention re cently [PV92, Jae94b, Jae94a]. We discuss lhree techniques here, and consider their application in the specific context of random worlds. As we shall see, all of our techniques are very closely based on well-known ideas in the litera ture. Two make use of cross-entropy, while the t11ird is a generalization of a method considered by Paris and Vencov ska [PV92]. They are conceptually and formally distinct, yet there are some interesting connections between them. In particular, in the context of random-worlds they gener ally yield the same answers (where the compruison makes sense; the various methods have different nmges of applica bility). Many of the results we discuss are, in general terms if not in specific details, already known. Nevertlleless, their combination is quite interesting.\nWe now describe the three methods in a lillie more detail. The first method we exrunine is perhaps the simplest to ex plain. We consider it first in t1Je context of random worlds. Fix N. Random worlds considers all of the worlds that have domain { 1, ... , N}, ru1d assumes they are equally likely, which seems reasonable in the absence of information to the contrary. But now suppose that we have a degree of belief such as Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8. In this case it is no longer reasonable to assume that all worlds are equally likely; our knowledge base tells us that the worlds where b is red are more likely than the worlds where b is not red. Nevenheless, there is a straightforward way of incorporating this informa tion. Rather than taking all worlds to he equally likely, we divide the worlds into two sets: those which satisfy Red( b) and those which satisfy -.Red( b). Our beliefs require that the first set have probability 0.8 \ufffdmd the second probability 0.2. But otherwise we can make the worlds within each set equally likely. This is consistent with the random worlds approach of making all worlds equally likely. Intuitively, we are considering the probability distribution on the worlds that is as close as possible to our original uniform distribu tion subject to the constraint that the set of worlds where Red( b) holds should have probability 0.8.\nWhat do we do if we have ru1 inference process other than random worlds? As long as it also proceeds by generating a prior on a set of possible worlds and then conditioning, we can deal with at least tl1is example. We simply use the prior generated by the method to ao;;sign relative weights to the worlds in the sets determined hy Red( b) and -.Red( b), and then scale these weights within each set so that the sets are assigned probability 0.8 ru1d 0.2 respectively. (Readers familiar with Jeffrey ' s rule [Jer92] will realize that this is es sentially an application of that rule.) Again, intuitively, we are considering the distribution closest to Ute original prior that gives the set of worlds satisfying Red( b) probability 0.8.\nUnfortunately, the knowledge bao;;e is rarely this simple. Our degrees of belief often place complex constraints on the probability distribution over possihle worlds. Never theless, we would like to maintain the intuition that we are considering the distribution \"closest\" to the original prior that satisfies the constnunts imposed by the KB. But how do we determine the \"closest\" distribution? One way is\nGenerating New Beliefs from Old 39\nby using cross-entropy [KL51]. Given two probability dis tributions p and p', the cross-entropy of p1 relative to J.l, denoted C(1/, 1\u2022), is a meao;;ure of how \"far\" J.t1 is from J.l [SJ80, Sho86]. Given an inference method that generates a prior and a set of constraints determined by the KB, we can t11en find the distribution on worlds satisfying the con straints tllat minimizes cross-entropy relative to the prior, and then use t11is new distribution to compute degrees of belief. We call this method CEW (for cross-entropy on worlds).\nThe next method we consider also uses cross-entropy, but in a completely different way. Suppose we have the (ob jective) knowledge base KBbird given above, and a separate .\"belief ha<;e\" BBbird = (Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8). As we sug gested, if the birdwatcher were sure Umt b was red, random worlds would give a degree of belief of 0.7 in Cardinal( b); similarly, if she were sure that b was not red, random worlds would give 0.1. Given that her degree of belief in Red{ b) is O.R. it seems reasonable to a\ufffdsign a degree of belief of O.R x 0.7 + 0.2 x 0.1 to Cardinal( b). In fact, if we consider any inference process I (not necessarily one that generates a prior prnhahility on possihle worlds), it seems reasonable to ddine\nI (Cardinal( b) I KBhird 1\\ BBbird) = 0.8 x I(Cardinal(b)JKBbirdi\\Red(b))\n+ 0.2 x I(Cardinal(b)JKBbird A -.Red( b)).\nMore generally, we might hope that given an inference process I and a knowledge bao;;e of t11e form KB A BB, we can generate from i t a collection of objective knowl edge hase\ufffd KD i, . .. , KB,. such tlmr I( 'PIKB /\\ BB) is a weighted average of I(;pJKBI), ... , I(lf'IKBm). as in the example. In general. however, achieving this in a reasonable fashion is not so easy. Consider t11e belief base BB\ufffd;rd = (Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8) 1\\ (Pr(.'inw/!(b)) = 0.6). In this case, we would like to define 1 (Cardinal( b )JKBbird 1\\ BB\ufffd;rd) us ing a weighted average of I( Cardinal(b)JKBbird /\\Red( b) 1\\ Snwll(b)), I(Cardinal(b)IKBbint 1\\ Red(b) 1\\ --,Smnll(b)), etc. As in the simple example, it seems reasonable to take the weight of the tenn l(Cardinal(b)JKBbird 1\\ Red(b) 1\\ Small( b)) to he the degree of belief in Red( b) 1\\ Smnll(b). Unfortunately, while ss;,;rd tells us t11e degree of belief in Red( /1) and Small( b) separately, it does not give us a degree of he lief for their conjunction. A superficially plausible heuristic would he to ao;;sume that Red( b) and Smnll(b) are independent. and thus assign degree of belief 0.8 x 0.6 to their conjunction. While this seems reasonable in this case, at other times it is completely inappropriate. For example, if our knowledge base asserts that all small things are red, then Red( b) and Snwll( b) cannot be independent, and we should dearly take the degree of belief in Red( b) 1\\ Smnll( b) to he the same a\ufffd the degree of belief in Small( b), namely, 0.6. In general, our new degree of belief for the formula Red(b) 1\\ Small(b) may depend not only on the new de grees of belief for the two conjuncts, but also on our old degree of belief !(Red( b) 1\\ Small(b )JKBb;rd). One reason able approach to computing t11ese degrees of belief is to make the smaflesr change possible to achieve consistency with the hclief hase. Here, as before, cross-entropy is a useful tool. Indeed, a\ufffd we shall show, there is a way of\n40 Bacchus, Grove, Halpern, and Koller\napplying cross-entropy in this context to give us a general approach. We call Ibis method CEF, for cross-entropy on formulas. Altbough both CEW and CEF use cross-entropy, they use it in conceptually different ways. As the names suggest, CEW uses cross-entropy to compare two probabil ity distributions over possible worlds, while CEF uses it to compare two probability distributions over formulas. On the other hand, any probability distribution on worlds gen erates a probability distribution on formulas in the obvious way ( tbe probability of a formula is the probability of the set of worlds where it is true), and so we can use a well-known property of the cross-entropy function to observe that the two approaches are in fact equivalent when they can hmh be applied.\nIt is worth noting that the two approaches are actua.lly in comparable in their scope of application. Because CEF is not restricted to inference processes tlJat generate a prior probability on a set of possible worlds, it can be applied to more inference processes than CEW. On the other hand, CEW is applicable to arbitrary KB's while, as we shall see, for CEF to apply we need to make more restrictions on the form of the KB. In Ibis paper, we focus on two instantiations of CEF. The first applies it to the random-worlds method. The second applies it to a variant of the maximum-entropy approach used by Paris and Vencovska [PV89] (and simililr in spirit to the metbod used by Jaeger [Jae94b)). which we henceforth call the ME (inference) process. Using results of [GHK92, PV89], we prove that t11ese two instmllial ions are equivalent.\nThe third method we consider also applies only to certain types of inference processes. In panicu1ar, it take\ufffd a.<. its basic intuition that all degrees of belief must ultimately he the result of some statistical process. Hence, it requires an inference process tlmt cm1 generate degrees of belief from statistics, like random-worlds. Suppose we have the belief Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8. If we view th is belief as having arisen from some statistical sampling process, then we can regard it as an abbreviation for statistical information ahout the class of individuals who are '\ufffdjust like b\". For example, say that we get only a quick glm1ce at b, so we are not certain it is red. The above assertion could be construed as being an abbreviated way of saying that 80% of the objects that give a similar sense perception are red. To capture this idea formally we can view b as a member of a small set of (possibly fictional) individuals S that are \"'just like b\" to the best of our knowledge, and assume that our degrees of belief about b actually represents the statistical information aboutS: IIRed(x)IS(x)llr \ufffd 0.8. Once all degree ofhelief assertions have been converted into statistical assertions. we can tben apply any method for inferring degn:es of belief from statistical knowledge bases. We call this the RS method (for representative set). The general intuition for this metbod goes back to statistical mechanics [Lan80J. It was also defined (independently it seems) by Paris and Vencovska [PV 92); we follow their presentation here.\nParis and Vencovska showed t11at the RS method and the CEF metbod agree when applied to their version of the ME process. Using results of[GHK92, PV89], we can show that\nthe methods also agree when applied to our version of the ME process and when applied to random worlds. Putting t11e results together, we can show that all these metbods CEW, CEF, and RS-agree when applied to random worlds and, in fact, CEW and CEF agree in general. In addition, t11e resulting extension of random worlds agrees with the approach obtained when we apply CEF and RS to the ME process. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review the formal model of [Ha190] for degrees of belief and statistical information, and some material from [13GHK93] regarding the random-worlds method. We give the formal definitions of t11e three metbods we consider in Section 3, and discuss their equivalence. In passing, we also discuss the connection to Jeffrey's rule, which is an other very well known met11od of updating by uncertain infonnation. We conclude in Section 4 witb some discus sion or computational issues and possible generalizations of lhesc approaches.\n2 Technical preliminaries\n2.1 A fit\u00b7st-ol'<ler logic of probahility\nIn [Hal90), a logic is presented that allows us to represent and reason with hoth statistical information and degrees of belief. We hriclly review the relevant mmerial here. We start with a standard first-order language over a finite vo cabulary <\ufffd, and augment it with proportion expressions and belief expressions. A basic proportion expression has the form 1!1/\u2022(;r)!O(J:)IIx and denotes the proportion of do main elements satisfying 1j; from among those elements satisfyin g B. (We take 111/;(.1:)11., to be an abbreviation for 11\ufffd1\u00b7( ;r) lmw(.r )11., .. ) On the other hm1d, a basic beliefexpres .l.ion has the form Pr( 1/J IO) m1d denotes tbe agent's degree or belief in 11\u2022 given 0. The set of proportion (resp. belief) expressions is formed by adding the rational numbers to the set of basic proportion (resp. belief) expressions and then closing off under addition m1d multiplication.\nWe compm\u00b7e two proportion expressions using the approx imate connective ::5 ( \"approximately less than or equal\"); the result is a proportion formu la. We use { \ufffd {' as an abbreviation for ({ ::5 e) 1\\ ({' ::5 0\u00b7 Thus, for example, we can express the statement \"90% of birds fly\" using the proportion formula IIFly(x)IBird(x)llx \ufffd 0.9.4 We com pare two belief expressions using standard \ufffd; the result is a basic belief{ormula. For example, Pr(Red( b)) \ufffd 0.8 is a ba\ufffdic belief formula . (Of course, Pr(Red(b)) = 0.8 can be expressed as the ohvious conjunction.) In the full language \u00a3 we allow arbitrary llrst-order quantification and nesting of belief and proportion formula'>. For example, complex fonnulas like Pr{V:t(I!Knmvs(:r., y)IIY ::5 0.3 ) ) \ufffd 0.5 are in\u00a3.\n4We remark that in [Hal90] there was no use of approximate equality (\ufffd). We use it here since, as argued in [BGHK93], its use is crucial in our intended applications. On the other hand, in [DGI !K93], we used a whole family of approximate equality func tions of the form\ufffd;. i = 1, 2, 3, . . .. To simplify the presentation, we use only one here.\nWe will also be interested in various sublanguages of \u00a3 . A fonnula in which the \"Pr\" operator does not appear is m1 objective formula. Such fonnulas are assigned truth values by single worlds. The sublanguage restricted to objective fonnulas is denoted by cobj . The standard random-worlds method is restricted to knowledge bases expressed in cobj . The set of belief formulas, coel, is fanned by starting with basic belief formulas and closing off under conjunction , negation, and first-order quantification. In contra<;t to ob jective fonnulas, the truth value of a belief fonnula is com pletely independent of the world where it is evaluated. A flat formula is a Boolean combination of belief formulas, such that in each belief expression Pr( 'P ) , the formula 'P is a closed (i.e., containing no free variables) object ive formu la. (Hence we have no nestinr, of \"Pr\" in nat formulas nor any \"quantifying in\".) Let \u00a3! at be the language consisting of the fiat fonnulas.\nTo give semantics to botl1 proportion formu la-; and belief formulas, we use a special case of what were called in [Hal90] type-3 structures. In particu lar, we consider type-:\ufffd structures of the fonn (WN , p.) , where WN consists of al l worlds (first-order models) with domain { I , . . . , A' } over the vocabu lary <ll, and Jl is a probabil i ty distribution over WN .5 Given a structure and a world i n that structure. we evaluate a proportion expression 1 1 1/\u2022 ( :\ufffd: ) IO( .r ) I I .,\u00b7 as the frac tion of domain elemen ts satisfying 1,1>( ;I' ) among those sat isfying O(x ) . We evaluate a belief formula using our proha bi1 ity distribution over tl1e set of possible worlds. More pre cisely, given a structure M = (WN , 11 ) , a world w E WN , a tolerance r E (0, I] (used to in terpret ::::::: and ::S), and a valuation V (used to interpret the free variables), we asso ciate with each fonnula a trutll value and with each belief expression or proportion expression ( a numher [ (j M , w ,v, r . We give a few representative clauses here:\n\u2022 If ( is tlle proportion expression I I \\0( .1: ) I \ufffd{1: ) I I ,. , then [(]M,w , v,r is the number of domai n elements in w sat is fying \\0 1\\ 1/; divided hy the numher sati sfyi n g ''' \u00b7 (Note that these numbers may depend on w . ) We take this fraction to be 1 if no domain elements satisfies \u00b7\ufffd \u00b7 .\n\u2022 I f ( is the belief expression Pr( 'P I I/' ) , then\n[(] _ p { tv1 : ( M, w' , V, r ) )= 'P 1\\ !}\u2022 }\nM,w ,V,r - p{w' : ( M, w1 , V, r ) )= 1}1} \u00b7 Again, we take this to he 1 if the denominator is 0.\n\u2022 If ( m1d ( ' are two proportion expressions. then (M, w, T, V) I= ( ::S (' iff\n[(]M,w , r ,V :S [(1]M ,w , r ,V + T. That is, approximate less than or eq ual allows a tolerance of r.\nNotice that if ( is a belief expression, then i ts value is independent of the world w. Moreover, if i t is closed then its value is independent of the valuat ion V. Thus, we can write [(]M,, in tllis ca..o;e. Similarly, if <p E \u00a311'1 is a closed\n5In general, type-3 structures additional ly allow for a distribu tion over the domain (in this case, { l , . . . , N} ) . Here, we always use the unifonn d isuibution over the domain.\nGenerating New Beliefs from Old 41\nbelief formula, its truth depends only on M and r, so we can write ( M, r) )= cp in this ca<;e.\n2.2 The random-worlds method\nGiven these semantics, tlle random-worlds method is now easy to describe. Suppose we have a KB of objective for mula\ufffd. and we wrull to a<;sign a degree of belief to a fonnula tp. Let p'f.v be the uniform distribution over WN, and let M!V = (WN , Jlf.r ) . Let Pr\u00bbrw (cpi KB) = [Pr(cpjKB)]MN , r \u00b7 Typically, we know only tl1at N i s large and that r is small.

It ha\ufffd been argued [Jay78] that entropy measures the amoun t of \"information\" in a probabi l i ty distribut ion, i n t h e sense of information tlleory. The uniform distribution has the maximum possible en tropy. In general, given some constraints on the probability distributions, the distribution with maximum entropy that satisfies the constraints cllil be viewed as the one that incor porates the least addit ional i nfonnation above and beyond the constraints.\nThe related cross-entropy function measures the additional information gained by moving from one distribution Jl to another uistri hut ion Jl1:\n( ' ( , '\\\"\" ' ( ) tl (w)\n.. \u00b7 I' , Jt ) = L 1'\u00b7 w In -( -) . p w w E n Various arguments have been presented showing that cross entropy measu res how close one probability distribution is to ano ther [S.TRO, Sho86) . Thus, given a prior distribution I' and a set S' of addi tional constraints, we are typically in terestcu in the unique distribution 1/ tllat satisfies S and minimizes C(p' , p ) . It is wel l-known tlmt a sufficient con dit ion for such a un ique distribution to exist is that the set of distributions satisfying S form a convex set, and that t here be at le<L<;t one distribution p\" satisfying S such that C(IJ'' , I ' ) is fin i te . These conditions often hold in practice.\n3 The three methods\n3.1 CEW\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, our first metllod, CEW, assumes as input an inference process I that proceeds by generati ng a prior Jl f on a set of possible worlds W1 and then conditioning on the objective information. Given such an inference process I, a knowledge base KB (that can con tain subjective infonnation) and an objective formula cp, we wish to compute CEIV( I)(<piKB), where CEW(I) is a\n42 Bacchus, Grove, Halpern, and Koller\nnew degree of belief generator that can handle knowledge bases that can include subjective infmmation.\nWe say that an inference process I is world-based if there is some structure M1 = (Wr , llt )and a tolerance r such that l(\ufffdPIKB) = [Pr(lf' IKB)]M1 , T . Notice that Pr;_;rw is world based for each N (where the structure corresponding to Pr;_;rw is MjV ). \ufffd, on the other hand, is not world-ba<;ed; we return to this point shortly.\nGiven a world-based inference process I, we define CEW(I) as follows: Given a knowledge base KB which can be an arbitrary formula in the full language .C, let Jt.}8 be the probability distribution on WI such t11at C(Jl}8, JlJ ) is minimized (if a unique such distribution exists) among all distributions tl such that (WI , p' , T) I= Pr(KB) = l. Intu i tively, pf8 is the probability distribution closest to the prior Jli that gives KB probability l . Let Mf8 = (WI , JLf8 ) . We can then define CEW(I)( c.oiKB) = [Pr( cp)J.\ufffd1Ks T . I ' The first thing to observe is that if KB is objective, then standard properties of cross-entropy can he used to show that pf8 is t11e condilional distri bu tion I'\u00b7 I C l KI3 ) . We thus immediately get:\nProposition 3.1: lfKB is objective, then CEW( I) ( <.pjKI3) = l(lf' IKB ) . Thus, CEW(I) is a true extension of !.\nAnother important property of CEW follows from the wel l known fact that cross-entropy generalizes Jeffrey 's rule [Jef92]. Standard probability theory tells us that if we start with a probability function p and observe that event E holds, we should update to the conditional probabi l i ty function Jl.( \u00b7 IE) . Jeffrey's rule is mean t to ueal wi th the possibility that rather than getting certain information. we only get partial information, such a<; that E holds with proh ability o:. Jeffrey's rule suggests that in tl1is case. we should update to the probability function p' such that\ntt' (A) = o:JI.( A IE) + ( I - rr )p ( A IE) .\nwhere E denotes the complement of E. 111is rule uniformly rescales the probabilities within E and (separately) those within E so as to satisfy the constrain t Pr( E) = a. Clearly, if o: = 1 , then Jl1 is just the conditional prohabi l i ty p( \u00b7 I E ) . This rule can be generalized i n a straight forward fashion . If we are given a family of mutually excl usive and ex haustive events \u00a31 , . . \u2022 , Ek with desired new prohahi l i t ies 0: 1 , . . . , ak (necessarily L:i c.r; = 1 ) , then we can define:\np'(A) = a, lt(A I El ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ni\\ I'\u00b7 ( A I Ek) .\nSuppose our knowledge base ha\ufffd; t he form ( Pr( 'PI ) = n 1 ) A \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A (Pr( lf'k ) = ak ) , where the If'; 's are mu tually exclusive and exhaustive objective fonnulas and c.r 1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + cr., = I . The formulas lf'l , . . . , lf't.: conespond to mu tually exclusive and exhaustive events. Tilus, Jeffrey's rule would suggest that to compute the degree of belief in If' given this knowl edge base, we should compute tile degree of belief in 'P given each of the If'; separately, and then take the linear combination. Using t11e fact Umt cross-entropy generalizes Jeffrey's rule, it is immediate that CEW i n fact docs this.\nPr\u00b7oposition 3.2: Suppose that I is a world-based inference process and that KB' is of the form KB A BB, where KB is objective and BB has the form (Pr( 1;?1) = o:t ) A \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A (Pr( lf'k ) = at.: ), where the lf'i 's are mutually exclusive and exhaustive objective formulas and cq + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + o:k = 1. Then\nk CEW(I)(c,o iKB') = L o:; I(If' IKB 1\\ cp; ) .\ni=l\nAs we observed above, CEW as stated does not apply di rectly to U1e random-worlds method Pr:. since it is not world-based . It is, however, the l imit of world-based meth ods . (This is also true for the ot11er methods considered in [BGH K92].) We can ea<;ily extend CEW so that it applies to limits of world-ba<;ed methods by taking limits in the obvious way. In particular, we define\nCEW(Pr':;;;; H'f' IKB) = l im lim CEW(Pr;,;rw)(\ufffdPIKB) , r - 0 N - oo\nprovided the limit exists. For convenience, we abbreviate CEW ( Pr:; ) as Pr\ufffdw. It is i nteresting to note that the distribution defined by CEW( Prrt\\\ufffd ) is the distribution of maximum entropy that satisfies the constraint Pr( KB) = l . 1l1is follows from the observation that the distri bution that minimizes the cross entropy from the uniform distribution among those distri butions sat isfying some constraints S', is exactly the distri bution or maximum entropy satisfying 5.6 This maximum entropy characterization demonstrates Umt Pr\ufffdw extends random worlds by making the probabilities of the possible worlds \"<t<; equal as possib le\" given the constraints.\n3.2 CEF\nParis and Vencovska [PV89] consider inferences processes that arc not world-based, so CEW cannot be applied to them. The method CEF we now define applies to arbitrary inference processes. but requ ires that the knowledge base be or a restri cted form. For the remainder of this section, we assume that the knowledge ba..;e has the fonn KB 1\\ BB, where KB i s an objective formula and B B (which we call the hclicr base) is in \u00a311\" ' . First. suppose for simplici ty that BB is ofUJe form Pr(th ) = d1 !\\ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A Pr( V-'d = Pk \u00b7 If U1e t/J; 's were mutually exclu sive, then we could define C E F( I)( lf'IBB) so that Propo si t ion 3.2 held . But what i f the \ufffd;; 's are not mutually exclu sive?\nConsider the r\\\u00b7 = 2!' atoms over \ufffd!J , . . . , 1/Jt.:. i .e., those conj unct ions or the form '1/\u2022; 1\\ . . . A l/JI, , where each 1/J: is ei t her \u00b7rJ>; or \u00b7\u00b7I/J1 \u2022 Atoms are always mutually exclusive and exhaust ive; so, if we could find appropriate degrees of helier for these atoms, we could again define things so that Proposi tion 3.2 holds. A simple way of doing this\n6We remark that in [GHK92, PV89] a connection was es lahlished between random worlds and maximum entropy. Here maximum entropy is playing a different role. It is being used here to extend rnndom worlds rather than to characterize properties of random worlds as in [GHK92, PV89).\nwould be to assume that, after conditioning, the a<>sertions 'if;; are independent. But, as we observed in the i ntroduction, assuming independence is inappropriate in general .\nOur solution is to first employ cross-entropy to find appro priate probabilities for these atoms. We proceed as follows. Suppose I is an arbitrary inference process, 1313 E Cf1a t , and 1/J1 , . . . , 1/Jk are the formulas that appear in subexpres sions of the form Pr( 'if;) in BB . We form the K = 2k atoms generated by the 'if;; , denoting them by A 1 , . . . , A K . Con sider the probability Jl defined on the space of atoms via t-t(Aj ) = I(Aj [KB ) .7 There is an obvious way of defining whether the formula B B is satisfied by a probability distri bution on the atoms A 1 , . . . , Ak (we defer t11e formal detai ls to the full paper), but i n general B B will not be sat isfied by the distribution 11. For a simple example, if we take the inference procedure to be random worlds and consider the knowledge base KBb;nJA(Pr(Red(b) ) = 0.8) from the intro duction, it turns out that P1-: (Red( b) [ KB,;,-d) is around 0 .57 . Clearly, the distribution 1 1 such that p.(Red( b ) ) is around 0.57 does not satisfy t11e constraint Pr(Red( b ) ) = 0 . 8 . Let Jl' be the probability distribution over the atoms that mini mizes cross-entropy relative to p among those that satisfy BB, provided tl1ere is a unique such distribution. We then define\nCEF(I) ( <p[KB A BB) = 1-\" (Al )I( 'P [ KB A A ! ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + JJ.' ( A K )! ( <p[ KB A A g ) _\nIt is immediate from the definition that CEF( I ) extends / . Formally, w e have\nProposition 3.3: lfKB, 'P E c\ufffd<j , then CEF( / ) (;p [KB ) = I('P [KB).\nBoth CEW and CEF use cross-entropy. However, the two applications are quite different. In the cm;e of CEW, we apply cross-en tropy witl1 respect to probabi l i ty distri bu tions over possible worlds, whereas with CEE we apply i t to probability distributions over formulas. Nevertheless, as we mentioned in the introduction , there is a t ight connection between the approaches, since any probahi l i ty distri bution over worlds defines a probabil it y distribution over fonnu las. In fact the following equ ivalence can be proved, usi ng simple properties of tJJe cross-emropy funct ion.\nTheorem 3.4 : Suppose I is a world-based i\ufffd[erence process, KB , <p E co\"i , and BB E [fl\u2022< \ufffd . Then CEW(I)(\ufffdP IKB A BB) = CEF( / ) ('P [KB A BB ).\nThus, CEF and CEW agree i n contexts where both are defined.\nBy analogy to tl1e defin ition for CEW, we define\nPr\ufffd\ufffd'(cp!KB A BB) = lim lim CEF(Pr\ufffdrw ) ( <p [ KB A BB ) . r-O N - ro\nI t immediately follows from Theorem 3 .4 that 7S ince BB E c,Jlat by assumption, and Pr cunnot be nested in a flat belief base, the 1/J'S are necessa1ily objective, and \ufffdo are the atoms they generate. Thus, l(A1 [KB) is well defined.\nGenerating New Beliefs from Old 43\nCorollary 3.5: {[ KB , IP E Co\"i , and BB E [flat, then Pr\ufffdw('P [KB A B B ) = Pr;;r(\ufffdt?[KB A BB).\nAs the notation suggests, we view Pr\ufffdF as the extension of rr: obtained by applying CEF. Why did we not define Pr\ufffdF as CEF(Pr: )? Clearly CEF(rr,:;) and Pr\ufffd\" are closely related. Indeed, if both are defined, then they are equal .\nTheon:m 3.6 : ff both CEF(Pr: )(<piKB A BB) and Pr\ufffdr( 'P IKB A BB ) are defined then they are equal.\nIt is qui te possible, in general, that eitller one of Pr\ufffd\" and CEF( Pr\ufffd ) is defmed while the other is not. The following example demonstrates one type of situation where Pr\ufffd\" is dell ned and CEF( PrC: ) is not. The converse situation typical ly ru\u00b7ises only in pathological examples. In fact, as we show in Theorem 3 .8, there is an important class of cases where the existence of CEF(Pr:; ) guarantees that of Pr\ufffdF.\nExample 3.7 : Suppose KB is [ [Fly(x) [Bird(x) [ [r \ufffd I A Rird (Tweety) and BB is Pr(Fly(Tweety) = 0) A Pr(Red( Tweety) = 1 ) . Then, just as we would expect, Pr\ufffd,\"'(Red( lll'eetv) [KB 1\\ BB) = 1 . On the other hand, CEF( P1\ufffd.,: ) (Red( 1\\veety ) [KB A BB) is undefined. To see why, let ;t be the probabi lity distribution on the four atoms ucfineu by Fly( 7\\veery) and Red(Tweety) determined by Pts-:;:: ( \u00b7 I KB) . S i nce Pts\ufffd ( Fly(Tweety) IKB) = I , it must he t he case that 11( Fly( Tweety) ) = 1 (or, more accu rately, ; t (Fiy(7 iveety) A Red( Tweety) ) + p(Fly(Tweety) A -.Red( liveetv) ) = l ) . On the other hand, any distri but ion 1/ over the four atoms defined by Fly(Tweety) and Red( 7iveety) that satisfies BB must be such that it' ( Fiy( 7iveety) ) = 0. It ea<;ily follows that if p' sat isfies BB, then C(p' , I ' ) = oo . Thus, there is not a unique uistrihu t ion over the atoms that satisfies BB and mi nimizes cross-entropy relative to p. This means that CEI,.( Prr;: ) (Red( 7\\veety ) IKB 1\\ BB) is undefined. I\nWe nex t consider what happens when we instantiate CEF w i th a part icular inference process considered by Paris and VL:ncovska that uses maximum entropy [PV89]. Paris and Vcncovska restrict at ten t ion to rather simple languages, cor responding to the not ion of \"essential ly propositional\" for m u l as de fined below. When considering (our variant) of their method we shal l make the same restriction.\nWe say that 1/\u2022 ( :r ) is an essentially propositional formula if i t is a quantifier-free first-order formula that mentions only u nary predicates (and no constant or function sym bols), whose only free variable is x . A simple knowl edge base K B abollt c ha<> the form l l'P t (x) IO, (x) l lr ::S o , 1\\ . . - A [ [ <pk ( :r ) [ fh ( x ) [ [ x ::S O:k 1\\ 1/;(c), where .,_., , , . . . , 'P k , O , , . . . , Ok , .,_;, are all essent ial ly propositional.8 The M E inference process is only defined for a simple\nM Nolice that I I'P( x ) fB ( 1: ) f [ . t o- is expressible as 1 1-.'P{ -\" ) [ B ( :r: ) f l x :::: I - a ; this means we can also express :::::: . I Iowcvcr. because of the fact that we disallow negations in a sim ple KB. we cannot express strict inequality. This is an important rcstriclion.\n44 Bacchus, Grove, Halpern, and Koller\nknowledge base about c and an essent ial ly propositional query <p( c) about c. Let KB :::: KB' 1\\ \u00a2(c) be \ufffdm essen t ial ly propositional knowledge base about c (where KB' is the part of the knowledge base that does not mention c). If the unary predicates that appear in KB are P = { Pt , . . . , Pk } , then KB' can be viewed as pu tting constraints on the 21: atoms over P .9 The fonn of KB' ensures that U1ere will be a unique distribution llme over Ulese atoms Ulat maxi mizes entropy and satisfies the constraints. We then de fine ME(<p(c) IKB' 1\\ Jj;(c)) to be Pme ( lf' l 1/! ) . Intuit ively, we are choosing the distribution of maximum entropy over the atoms that satisfies KB' , and treating c a<; a \"nmdom\" ele ment of Ule domain, assuming i t satisfies each atom over P wiili Ule probabil ity dictated by Jlme\u00b7\nTo apply CEF to ME, we also need to put restrictions on tlle belief base. We say that D B E .cJrat is an es\u00b7 sentially propositional belief base about c i f every basic proportion expression has the fonn Pr( y( c ) I O ( c ) ) , where <p and B are essential ly proposi t ional . (In part icu lar, this disallows statistical fotmula<; in the scope of Pr.) A simple belief base about c is a conjunction of the form Pr(<pt (c)IBt (c )) ::; O'J 1\\ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Pr( <pl: ( c) I Ok { c) ) ::; o k . where all oftlle fonnulas that appear are essentially proposi tional. We can only apply CEF to ME if the knowledge ba\ufffde has the fonn KB 1\\ BB, where KB is a simple knowledge hase about c and BB is a simple belief ba\ufffde about c. It fol lows from results of [GHK92, PV89] that random worlds and ME give the same results on their common domain. Hence, they are also equal after we apply tl1e CEF transformation. Moreover, on Ulis domain, if CEF(Pr\ufffd ) is defi ned , then so is Pr\ufffdF. (The converse docs not hold, as shown hy Example 3 .7.) Thus, we get\nTheorem 3.8: If KB is a simple knowledge base about (\", BB is a simple belief base about c, and '-P is on essenTially propositionalformu!a, then CEF(ME)(<p(c) I KB A BB) :::: CEF( Prr,.: ) ('-P ( c ) IKD A I3 I3 ) .\nMoreover, ifCEF(ME)( <p(c) IKB A B B ) is defined, then\nCEF(ME) (<p(c) IKB A BB) = Pr\ufffdF('-P( c ) IKB A B B ) .\n3.3 RS\nThe last method we consider, RS, is based on the intu ition that degree of belief a\ufffdsertions must u ltimately arise from statistical statements. This general idea goes hack to work in Ule field of statistical mechanics [LanRO), where it has been applied to the problem of reasoning abou t the total energy of physical systems. If the system consists of many particles then what is, in essence, a random-worlds analysis can be appropriate. If the energy of the system is known exactly no conceptual problem arises: some possible configurations have the specified energy, while others are impossible because they do not. However, it turns out that i t i s frequently more appropriate to assume that all we know is the expected energy. Unfortunately, i t questionable whether\n9 An atom over P is an atom (as defi ned ahove ) over the for mulas P1 ( x ) . . . . , Pk (x ) .\nthis i s really an \"objective\" a-;sertion about the system in que.\ufffdtion, 10 and in fact the physicist<; encounter a problem analogous to that which motivated our paper. Like us, one response they have considered is to modify the assump tion of unifonn probability and move to maximum entropy (thus using, essentially, an instance of our CEW applied to a uniform prior). But another response is the fol lowing. Physical ly, expected energy is appropriate for systems in thermal equilibrium (i .e. , at a constant temperature). But in practice this means Ulat Ule system is in Ulennal contact with a (generally much larger) system, sometimes called a heat bath. So another approach is to model the system of in terest a> being part of a much larger system, including the heat bath, whose total energy is truly fixed. On Ulis larger scale, random-worlds is once again applicable. By choosing the energy for the total system appropriately, Ule expected energy of the smal l subsystem will be as speci fied . Hence. we have converted subjective statements into objective ones, so that we are able to use our standard tech niques. In this domain, there is a clear physical intuition for the connect ion between t11e objective infonnation (Ule energy of the heat bath ) and the subjective infonnation (the expected energy of the small system).\nA more recent, and q ui te different, appearance of Ulis intu i t ion is in the work of Paris and Vencovska [PV92) . They dell ned their method so that i t ha<> the same restricted scope as the ME method. We present a more general version here, that can handle a somewhat richer set of knowledge bases. although i ts scope is still more restricted than CEF. It can deal with arbitrary inference processes, but Ule knowl edge hase must have the form KB 1\\ BE, where KB is object ive and D B is an essentially propositional belief base ahou t some constant c . The first step in the method is to transform 13 I3 in to an objective formula. Let S be a new unary predicate, representing the set of individuals \u00b7\ufffdust l ike c\". We transform BD to KBnn by replacing all tenus of the form Pr( 1/J( c ) I D (c ) ) by 1 1 1/!(x) IB(x) 1\\ S(x) l l:t- . and replacing all occmTences of ::; by \ufffd . We then add Ule cnnj uncts I I S( :r l l l, ::::: 0 <md S(c), since S is assumed to he a small set and c must be in S. For example, if D B is Pr(Red(c)) ::; 0.8 A Pr(Small(c)) :::: 0.6, then the nmcsponding KBnn is ( I IRed(x) IS(x) l l x \ufffd 0.8) 1\\ ( / ISmu//( :r J IS(:r ) l l, \ufffd 0.6) 1\\ ( / I S(.z: ) l /\ufffd\u00b7 ::::: 0) I\\ S(c). We then define RS( ! ) ( <p( c ) IKB A BB ) = I( IP( c) IKB A KBaa) . I t is almost immediate from the defini tions that if BB is a simple bel ief base ahout c, then RS(Pr,:)(<p(c) IKB A D B ) = limr - o limN - = RS(Pr;r)(<piKB). We abbrevi ate RS( Prr;;: ) as Pr\ufffd .\nIn general, RS and CEF are distinct. This observa tion fol lows from results of [PV92) concerning an infer ence process CM, showing that RS(CM) cannot be equal to CEF( CM ) . On the other hand, Uley show Ulat, in the restricted setting in which ME applies, RS(ME) CEF( ME ) . Since ME = Pt\ufffd in this set ting, we have:\nif'lf it is objective. it is most plausibly a statement about the average energy over time. While this is a reasonable viewpoint, it does not real ly escape from philosophical or technical problems either.\nTheorem 3.9: If KB is a simple knowledge base about c, BB is an essentially propositional knowledge base about c, and tf; is an essentially propositional formula, then\nCEF(rc:)(<p(c) IKB /\\ BB) \"\" CEF(ME)(<p(c) !KB II BB) = RS(ME)(<p(c) !KB II BB) = Pr\ufffd (<p(c) I KB II BB) .\n4 Discussion\nWe have presented three methods for extending inference processes so that they can deal with degrees of belief. We view the fact that the three methods essentially agree when applied to the random-worlds method a\ufffd evidence validat ing their resul t as the \"appropriate\" extension of random worlds .\nSince our focus was on extending the random-worlds method here, there were many issues th at we were not able to i nvestigate thoroughly. We mention two of the more significant ones here:\n\u2022 Our definitions of CEF \ufffdUld RS a;;sume certain rest ric tions on the form of the knowledge base, which are not assumed in CEW. Is it possible to ex tend these methods so that they apply to more general knowledge bases? In this context, it is worth not i ng that RS ha\ufffd 4uitc a dif ferent flavor from the other t wo approaches. Tt1e basic idea involved seems to be to ask \"What objec!ive facts might there be to cause one to have the belicl\"s in I3 B \u00b7)\". Given an answer to this, we add these facts to KB in l ieu of BB; we can U1en apply whatever inference process we choose. We do not see m1y ph i losophical reason that prevents application of U1is idea in wider contexts than belief bases about some constant c . The technical prob lems we have found trying to do this seem dirtlcult but not deep or intractable.\n\u2022 We have essential ly a.;;sumed what might be viewed as concurrent rather U1ru1 sequential updat ing here. Sup pose our knowledge base contains two constraints: Pr(<pt ) = u 1 1\\ Pr(<p2 ) = o\u00b72 \u00b7 Although we cannot u s u  ally apply Jeffrey's rule to such a conj unction, we can ap ply the rule sequentially, first u pdating by Pr( <p1 ) = n 1 , and then by Pr( <p2) = et 2 \u2022 We have described our meth ods in ilie context of updating by any set of constraints at once, but they can also be defined to update by con straints one at a time. TI1e two possibilit ie.\ufffd usual ly give different results. Sequential updating may not preserve any but the last constraint used, and in general is order dependent. Whether this should be seen a-; a problem depends on U1e context. We note that in the very spe cial case in which we are updating by objective facts (i.e., conditioning) sequential and concutTent updat ing coincide. This is why this issue can be ignored when doing Bayesian condi tioning in general, and in ordinary random\u00b7worlds in particular. We have only considered concurrent updates in this paper, but the issue surely deserves deeper investigat ion .\nReferences\n[BGHK92] F. Bacchus, A J . Grove, J. Y. Halpern, and D. Koller.

But allowing a know l \u00ad edge base to contain only objective information is sometimes limiting. We occa<;ionally wish to include infonnation about degrees of belief in the knowledge base as well, because there are contexts in which old be1iefs represent important information that should influence new beliefs. In this paper, we describe three quite general techniques for extending a method that generates degrees of belief from objective informa\u00ad tion to one that can make use of degrees of belief as well. All of our techniques are ha<;ed on well-known approaches, such a5 cross-emropy. We discuss gen\u00ad eral connections between the techniques and in partic\u00ad ular show that, although conceptually and technically quite different, all of the techniques give the same answer when applied to the random-worlds method.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
