We impose constraints on the form of the sentences that guarantee that the knowl\u00ad edge base contains all the probabilistic infor\u00ad mation necessary to generate a network. We define the concept of d-separation for knowl\u00ad edge bases and prove that a knowledge base with independence conditions defined by d\u00ad separation is a complete specification of a probability distribution. We present a net\u00ad work generation algorithm that, given an in\u00ad ference problem in the form of a query Q and a set of evidence E, generates a network to compute P(QIE).
