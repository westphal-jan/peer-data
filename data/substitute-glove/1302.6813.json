Numerical formalisms attach degrees of belief to propositions. Belief degrees are understood as a measure on the set of possible worlds (possible state descriptions) that assigns to every proposition the measure of the set of worlds in which the proposi tion is true. Therefore, uncertainty measures are not truth-functional, as it is welt known and established, i.e. the measure of a compound formula can not be in general obtained as a function of the measures of its subformulas.\nPossibilistic logic ( cf. e.g. [Dubois & Prade, 88]) is a particular numerical formalism based on the use of the so-called possibility and necessity measures that provide to what extent a crisp piece of knowledge can be considered plausible and certain respectively. Even if formulas bear numerical possibilities, we may be in terested not in the values themselves but only in their comparison, i.e. in formulas such as A <l B saying for instance that B is at least as possible as A_ In this direction, a qualitative characterization of possi-\nbility measures was first given in [Dubois 86), where it was established a formal relation between possibil ity theory and qualitative possibility relations. Since then several logics of qualitative possibility have been proposed to allow specifying partial qualitative pos sibility relations and deriving consequences based on this partial information. Farinas and Herzig [Farinas & Herzig, 91] axiomatize the logic of qualitative possibil ity called QP L, introducing a conditional connective 2:, and they relate it to the Lewis' conditional logic V N. They also propose a multi-modal logic based on sphere semantics to fully support possibility the ory. Boutilier presents in [Boutilier, 92] a possible worlds semantics for qualitative possibility relations and defines two modal logics, co and co\u00b7, and he makes use of two modalities to capture possibilistic logic. One corresponds as usual to truth at acces sible worlds while the other to truth to inaccessible worlds. Finally, in [Bendova & Hajek, 93] qualitative possibilistic logic is related to a tense logic with finite linearly preordered time called F LPOT, pushing fur ther some aspects of the previous works, specially the incompleteness of Q P L and the ptecise relation of the above modal systems with unary modalities to QPL. It is also worth noticing that similar attempts of re lating other quantitative and qualitative uncertainty measures have been proposed in the literature. See for instance [Segerberg, 71] or [Bacchus, 90] for the case of probability measures or [Harmanec & Hajek, 94], [Resconi, Klir & St. Clair, 92] for belief and plausibil ity measures. See also [Wong et a!., 91].\nOn the other hand, vagueness (fuzziness) concerns de grees of truth, usually numerical, and therefore one is led to many-valued logics as underlying formalism. In this sense, fuzzy logic deals with fuzzy propositions that may have intermediate degrees of truth and it is usually understood as truth-functional, i.e. the truth degree of a compound formula is a function of the truth degrees of its subformulas using suitable connectives. Because of this key feature, fuzzy logic departs from any uncertainty logic.\nSo far, as argued elsewhere ([Godo & Mantaras, 93], [Hajek, 93], [Hajek & Harmancova, 93]), we have seen that qualitative uncertainty (possibility) leads to\nOn Modal Logics for Qualitative Possibility in a Fuzzy Setting 279\nmodal logics, while fuzziness leads to many-valued log ics. Therefore, presence of both fuzziness and uncer tainty leads to calculi that are both many-valued and modal. Modal many-valued logics have been already investigated by some authors, see for instance [Oster mann, 88} or [Fitting, 92}. Our goal is to study logical systems of qualitative possibility dealing with fuzzy propositions. It is clear then that the first question one is faced with is how to compare formulas of fuzzy logic with respect to their possibility or, more general, with respect to the possibility measures of worlds on which they have a given truth-value. This question has not an unique answer. For instance, in a recent and very related works [Hajek & Harmancova, 93}, [Hajek, Harmancova & Verbrugge, oo] the possibility of a fuzzy formula is described by a fuzzy truth-value, i.e. a function that provides, for each truth-value c:r, the possibility of the fuzzy formula being a-true. The corresponding modal calculus QF L of comparison of possibilities is there shown to have a faithful interpre tation in a certain many-valued tense logic (with lin early preordered time), and thus naturally extending the results in [Bendova & Hajek, 93].\nIn the present paper we investigate qualitative fuzzy logics based on an alternative definition of possibility of a fuzzy formula, following the well known Zadeh's extension of classical possibility measures to fuzzy propositions (cf. [Zadeh, 78] [Dubois & Prade, 85]). With this definition, the possibility of a formula of fuzzy logic is again only one value. Furthermore, in our setting the possibility of a formula is just a truth value. To simplify matters, we make the following de sign choices: we investigate finitely valued Lukasiewicz fuzzy logics where the set Values of truth values co incides with the set of allowed possibility degrees. We show that this notion is useful to express statements about qualitative possibility comparisons. The corre sponding comparative logic QF \u00a321 is shown to sat isfy reasonable axioms and to be closely related to the many-valued analogue MV 55 of the modal logic 55. In Artificial Intelligence, 55 is often understood as the logic of knowledge whereas its weakening I< D45 is understood as the logic of belief (cf [Voorbraak, 93}, [Halpern & Moses, 92}). We relate our calculi also to K D45 and its many-valued counterpart MVKD45. Completeness theorems for MV55 and MV f{ D45 are obtained. This is not a too surprising result; [Fit ting, 92] has much about completeness of many valued modal logics and [Ostermann, 88] too. But we present Hilbert-style systems and get their completeness. Cf. also [Nakamura, 91a, 91b] for a different approach.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the underlying many-valued propositional calculus is de scribed. In Section 3, possible world semantics for the qualitative fuzzy logic Q F L2 is introduced, while in Section 4 we prove its faithful interpretation on the many-valued modal MV55, also described in this sec-\n1 The subindex 2 distinguishes our logic from the logic QF L of [Hajek & Harmancova] .\ntion. Finally, in Section 5 the logic MV f{ D45 is pre sented and proved that Q F L2 can be also faithfully interpreted there. We end with some concluding re marks.\n2 MANY-VALUED PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS USED\nFix a natural number n ;?: 2; we base our investigations over the n-valued propositional Lukasiewicz's logic Ln, as described e.g. in [Gottwald, 88]. This choice does not imply that we claim Lukasiewicz's logic be the only formal logical system for fuzzy logic. Our set of truth values is Values= {0, 1/(n-1), . . . , 1}. Principal con nectives are implication and negation, denoted respec tively by-+ and ...,, with Lukasiewicz semantics: ...,A is interpreted by 1- x and A-+ B by min(l- x + y, 1) where x , y E Values are the interpretations of A and B respectively; occasionally we write I(x, y) for min(l- x + y, 1). Other connectives are defined from -+and-,, in particular, there are two conjunctions and two disjunctions. We have the connectives 1\\ and V, interpreted by min(x, y) and max(x, y) respectively, and & interpreted by max(O, x + y- 1), and its dual Y... interpreted by min(l, x + y). The equivalence con nective +-+ is interpreted by min(I(x, y), l(y, x)). A complete axiomatization of Ln extends the celebrated axiomatization of L00 [Rose and Rosser, 58] by some few additional axioms, namely:\n\u2022 A-+ (B-+ A), \u2022 (A_, B)-+ ((B-+ C)-+ (A-+ C)), \u2022 (...,B_,...,A)-(A-+B), \u2022 ((A_, B)-+ B)-+ ((B-+ A)-+ A),\ni=l i=1 n-1 m m-1\n\u2022 L:cii Ay_(...,A& L A)), i=1 j=1 i=1\nfor 1 < m < n - 1 such that m - 1 does not divide n-1, and where 2:::7=1 A stands forAY... . . _n) . . . Y...A and 07=1 A for A& . . . \"l . . . &A. Note the !-tautologies (A-. (B ___.C)),..... ((A&B) _,C) and (...,(A_, B)) ...... (A&-,B). Further note the !-tautology (A -> B) ...... ( ...,B -+ ..,A). We extend Ln by unary connectives (co efficients) ( i) for each i E Values; the value of ( i)A is 1 iff the value of A is i, otherwise the value of (i)A is 0. In fact the connectives ( i) are definable in Ln, see [Ostermann, 88] or [Gottwald, 88]. Finally notice that Dienes and Godel's implications are also definable in Ln as -.A V B and (1)(A-> B) V B respectively.\nIn the sequel, the constant True will stand for A -> A, False for -,True, and B0-formulas will be formulas generated from formulas of the form ( i)A using con nectives and coefficients. Clearly, each such a formula\n280 Hajek, Hannancova, Esteva, Garcia, and Godo\nis Boolean in the semantic sense: it takes only values 1 and 0. (Later we introduce another class of formulas that are Boolean). We list next some axioms on formu las containing coefficients ( cf. [Hajek & Harmancova, 93]); in fact they are provable (by definability of coef ficients and completeness of axioms for Ln)\u00b7\nv(i)A, A ,((i)A \"(j)A), ; i:f.j\n(i)A--+ (1- i)--,A\n((i)A 1\\ (j)B) __.

C))2\nThe only deduction rule is modus ponens. This ends our description of the underlying propositional calcu lus.\n3 KRIPKE MODELS, POSSIBILITIES\nOur possibilistic Kripke models over a set Atom of propositional atoms have the form\n[{ = (W, lh rr)\nwhere W is a non-empty set of possible worlds, If maps Atom x W into Values, 1r maps W into Values and maxw EW rr( w) = 1. Recall that we consider possi bilities taking values only in Values. We extend If- in the obvious way to a mapping (denoted again by If-) of Forma x W into Values where Form0 is the set of all formulas of our propositional logic satisfying the usual inductive conditions. We write II A llw= i for If-( A, w) = i. Concerning satisfiability, we shall write wlf-A iff II A llw= 1. (Note II A llw= i iff wlf-(i)A.) The corresponding notions of validity and semantical entailment are the usual ones.\nAfter Zadeh ( cf. [Zadeh 1978], [Dubois & Prade, 86)), we introduce the following notion of the possibility degree of a {fuzzy) formula A E Form0 in a possibilis tic Kripke model, that extends to many-valued propo sitions the notion of classical possibility measure for two-valued propositions which plays a central role in possibilistic logic.\n2 Nate that this formula is one of famous axioms of the classical two-valued propositional calculus; it is sound for boolean formulas but not for all formulas.\nDefinition 3.1 II(A) = supw(rr(w) 1\\ II A llw)\u00b7\nThe corresponding dual notion of necessity can be then as N(A) = 1- II( -,A)= infw(1- rr(w)V II A llw)\u00b7 The idea behind the above definition is to use it in next sections to interpret in our comparative logic QF L2 sentences of type B is at least as possible as A, being A and B many-valued, as II(A) ::; II(B). This inter pretation extends to the fuzzy (many-valued) case , in a different way than QF L, the comparison of possibili ties that is present in the qualitative possibilistic logics QP L, CO and F LPOT mentioned in the introduction section. However, it is worth noticing that other ways of extending the notion of possibility for fuzzy propo sitions have been also advocated; see [Dubois & Prade, 92] for a discussion of such extensions. Next lemmas show a characterization of possibility measures II given by possibilistic Kripke models.\nLemma 3.2 {cf. {Dubois fj Prade, 1988]} For each possibilistic Kripke model K, II satisfies the following:\n(IIl) II(True) = 1, II(False) = 0\n(II2) II(A VB)= max(II(A), II(B))\n(II3) if Ln f-A+-+ B then II(A) = II(B)\n(II4) II(A) = V{i 1\\ II((i)A)) i\nProof\" We only prove the last equality. II(A) supw(rr(w) 1\\ II A llw) = sup;((supiiAII .. =i1T(w)) 1\\ i) = sup;(i 1\\ II((i)A). \u2022\nLemma 3.3 Assume the set Atom of propositional atoms to be finite. If a mapping II : Forma --+ [0, 1] satisfies the axioms (II 1- II4) of the preceding lemma then there is a finite Kripke model f{ such that II is the possibility given by f{.\nProof\" Note that (II4) guarantees that it is enough to produce a Kripke model f{ whose possibility coincides with II for B0-formulas. Now it is easily seen that each B0-formula .is equivalent to a Boolean combination of formulas of the form (i)p where p is a propositional atom. Therefore, we may produce a model f{ in full an ' alogy to the two-valued case: each B0-formula B is Ln-equivalent to a disjunction of maximal elemen tary conjunctions of the form (\\7':_1 (j; )p;, where m is the cardinality of the set Atom, thus for each such B there is a maximal elementary conjunction C such that II(B) = II(C). Thus we construct our model from the elementary conjunctions in the usual way. \u2022\nNotice that, given a possibilistic Kripke model K = {W, If-, rr) over a set Atom of atoms, if p is a propo sitional variable not in Atom, I< clearly determines uniquely a model I<' = {W, If-') over Atom' = Atom U {p} such that If-' coincides with If- on Atom and lf-'(p, w) = rr(w) for each w E W. (K' has no ex plicit structure on W .) Models of the form {W, IH\nOn Modal Logics for Qualitative Possibility in a Fuzzy Setting 281\nwill be called MVS5-models (for obvious reasons, see below). If ]{' = (W, It-') is an MVS5-model over Atom U {p} such that max{ll p llwl w} = 1 then it de termines uniquely a possibilistic model I< = (W, lh 1r) where If- is the restriction of If-' to Atom x W and 1r(w) = lf-(p, w) for all w E W. We shall identify /{ and K' without any danger of misunderstanding.\nIn the next section we shall introduce various modal ities defined in our Kripke models, among them the modality of comparison of possibilities.\n4 SOME MODALITIES, THE FUZZY LOGIC QF L2 AND ITS RELATION TO THE MODAL\nMANY-VALUED LOGIC MVS5\nWe enrich our language by three modalities, 0, Op and <lp (for Atom' = AtomU{p}) and define their seman tics as follows.\nII OA l]w= max{ll A llw'l w' E W};\nII OpA llw= max{ll pi\\ A llw'l w' E W}; A <lp B is OrA- OpB\nthe corresponding duals DA, DpA and A -<p B being defined as\u00b7 -,0-,A, ....,op...,A and ...,{...,A <lp -.B) respec tively.\nNote that formulas OA, OpA and A <lp B take a con stant value independently of a given wE W. Thus we shall write from now on II OA II, II OpA II etc. Next lemma summarizes properties and relations among the above modalities; note that we work with models K' in which max(ll p llwl w) = 1, i.e. II Op II= 1.\nLemma 4.1 The following properties hold for any formulas A and B:\n(a) II DA II= min{ II A llw I wE W}\n(b) II OpA II= II(A), II DpA II= N(A)\n{c) OpA is equivalent to O(p A A), DpA is equivalent to D( ...,p VA)\n{d) A -<p B is equivalent to DpA- DPB\n(e) II A <l p B II= 1 iff II (A) ::; II (B), II A -<p B II= 1 iff N(A) ::; N(B)\n(f) OpA is equivalent to True <l P A, DpA is equivalent to True -<p A\nwhere ll (and N) is defined by extension of definition 3.1 to any formula in the obvious way.\nThus it is clear that the modality Op captures the pos sibility n whereas the binary modality <lp captures the comparison of possibilities. Furthermore, the lemma shows that OP and <l P are interdefinable and both are\ndefinable from 0. So it makes sense, for our purposes of investigating the logic of comparison of possibilities, to axiomatize the D modality. This is our next task.\nFirst, observe that if a formula A is Boolean (takes only values 0,1) then OA is also Boolean; but of course OpA need not be Boolean. Define the class of B formulas to be the class of formulas resulting from formulas of the form (i)A, where A is an arbitrary formula, possibly containing modalities, using connec tives. Thus each B-formula is Boolean.\nDefinition 4.2 The modal logic MVSS has the fol lowing axioms:\n\u2022 propositional axioms as in Section 2 but the ax IOms\nA..,_. (l)A, A- (B ___.C)- ({A___. B)- (A- C)) are postulated for all B-formulas, not only Eo formulas;\n\u2022 modal axioms:\nD(A -> B) - (DA - DB) DA ->A DA- DDA OA---+ DOA\n(\ufffd i)(DA) +-+ D(\ufffd i)A } Fitting- like\n(Clearly, (\ufffd i)A stands for Vr?.;(j)A .)\nDeduction rules are : modus ponens, necessitation and ''from A infer (1)A \".\nTheorem 4.3 (Completeness). MVS51- A iff A is a 1-tauto/ogy for MVSS-models.\nThe proof is standard and sketched at the end of this section.\nNext step is to formally introduce our qualitative modal logic for comparison of possibilities of fuzzy propositions, and to faithfully embed it in MVS5\nDefinition 4.4 The qualitative modal fuzzy logic QFL2 over a set Atom of atoms has formulas built up from atoms (propositional variables) using logical connectives and a binary modality <l; models are pos sibilistic models (W, lh rr) and the semantics is\nII A<] B II=\n= I(maxw(ll A l[w A7r(w)), maxw(ll B llw J\\1r(w))).\nIt is worth noticing that Jl A <l B II= 1 iff II(A) ::=::; ll(B).\nDefinition 4.5 Given a variable p not in Atom, the translation of QFL2 formulas to MVSS formulas is de fined recursively as follows:\n282 Hajek, Harmancova, Esteva, Garcia, and Godo\nq* is q for q E Atom,\n(A ----> B)* is A* ----> B* and similarly for other con nectives,\n(A <l B) * is A* <lp B*.\nFinally define A \u2022\u2022 to be ( 1 )Op ----> A \u2022 .\nTheorem 4.6 The above mapping ** is a faithful in terpretation of QF L2 in MVS5, i.e. a formula A of Q F L2 is a )-tautology iff A\"* is a MVS5-tautology.\nProof: Let K = {W, lh 1r) be a rriodel of Q F L2 and let wlf-(i)A. Then K' = (W, I\ufffd') constructed above is a model of MVS5 and K'lf-'(l)Op, wlf-'(i)A* and hence wlf-'A**. Thus if A** is a 1-tautology of MVSS, then A is a 1-tautology of QFL2.\nConversely, let K1 = {W, I\ufffd') be a MVS5-model (of the language extended by p). If Kdf-'( < l)Op then clearly K1lf-'(l)A**; if I<d\ufffd'(l)Op then I<1 =I<' for the obvious I<. If wlf-'(i)A** then wl\ufffd'(i)A* and wlf-(i)A. Thus if A is a 1-tautology of QF L2 then A** is a 1-tautology of MVS5. \u2022\nIn the rest of this section we sketch a proof of the completeness of MVS5.\nRecall B-formulas; a theory is a set of B-formulas in cluding all formulas (1)C where Cis MVS5-provable. T f- C (T proves C) if there is a proof of C from T using only modus ponens (no necessitation). T is com plete if for each B-formula C, T f- C or T f- ...,c. As usual, it suffices to show the following Lemma.\nLemma 4. 7 (M azn Lemma) If To is a complete the ory and T 0 f- ( i)A then there is a model /{ = {W, I\ufffd) and a wE W such that wiHi)A.\nTo build such a model we need first some previous results.\nDefinition 4.8 Let T and To be complete theories. We say that T and To are equivalent, written T Ri T0, provided that for each i and A, T f- ( i) DA iff T0 f (i)DA, or equivalently, T f- (i)OA iff To f- (i)OA.\nLemma 4.9 MVS5 f- (i)OC----> (D(:S i)C 1\\ O (i )C ) .\nCorollary 4.10 If To f- ( i)OC then\n(a) (VT Ri T0 )(T f- (:S i)C)\n(b) (3TRiT0)(Tf-(i)C)\nProof: Easy, from compactness, like in [Hajek & Har mancova, 93]. \u2022\nNow the definition of the model follows.\nDefinition 4.11 For each i and C such that To f (i)OC, let Tc be a complete theory satisfying (b) in\nthe above corollary. We define the model I<= {W, If-) such that the set of models is W = {To} U {Tc I C arbitrary} and the forcing relation is defined by Tlf-(i)p i!JT f- (i)p, for any T E W.\nFinally, completeness comes immediately from next lemma.\nLemma 4.12 For each formula B, and each T E W, T f- (i)B iff Tlf-(i)B.\nProof: Induction step for <> B: Assume T f (i)OB, T E W . Then T f- D(:S; i)B, thus for each T' E W, T' f- D(:S i)B, thus T' f- (:S i)B (using DD ----> D), thus T'lf-(j)B for some j :S i, by the in duction hypothesis. On the other hand, T0 f- <>( i)B implies TB f- (i)B and by the induction hypothe sis, TBJf-(i)B. Hence i = max{jj B JITJ T E W}, i =II <>B II- This completes the proof of this lemma and of the Main Lemma 4. 7. \u2022\nCorollary 4.13 MVSS is complete with respect to the given semantics.\n5 THE LOGIC Q F L2 AND A MANY-VALUED BELIEF LOGIC\nThe QF L2 comparative modality <l introduced in the previous section relies fundamentally on the MVS5 modality <>p. Therefore it seems interesting to inves tigate a possible axiomatization of the modality Op itself, without needing to refer it to any other modal ity. To this end, in this section we relate our QF L2 to a many-valued version of the belief logic K D45 (see e.g. [Voorbraak]). Our MV /{ D45 will be a subtheory of MVS5 (like f{ D45 is a subtheory of 55); if there are only two values (Values= {0, 1}) then MV K D45 becomes K D45 like MV 55 becomes 55. Moreover, a faithful embedding of QF L2 into MV /{ D45 is very easy to define.\nModels of MV /{ D45 are again possibilistic Kripke structures /{ :::: (W, 1\ufffd, 11'), where 71' is a normalized possibility distribution on W with values in Values that can be understood as a many-valued accessibility relation R defined as R(w, w') = 1r(w' ). Such many valued accessibility relations already occur in [Fitting, 92].\nThe semantics of the MV [{ D45 modalities D, 0 is as follows:\nIIOBII= maxw( IIBIIw l\\1r(w) ), IIDBII=II-.0-.BII-\nNext lemmas show the M V f{ D45-validity of some for mulas that will be taken later as axioms of our logic.\nLemma 5.1 The formulas\nD(A----> B) ----> (DA --t DB),\nOn Modal Logics for Qualitative Possibility in a Fuzzy Setting 283\nDA ._...

The rest are easily proved by straightforward compu tations. It suffices to show that\nII DA--+ DB 11211 D(A--+ B) II. We have in the one hand II DA -+ DB II= I( minw { 1- 7r(w) v IIAIIw},minw\u2022{l - 1r(w') v IIBIIw\u2022l) = maxwminw\u2022I(l-7r(w) VII A llw, 1-1r(w') VII B llw,) 2: min wi(l-7r(w) VJIAIIw,l-7r(w) V IIB IIw), and in the other hand II D(A --+ B) II= minw{l-1r(w) V I(ll A llw, II B llw)}. Thus if we prove\nI(l-1r(w) v IIAIIw,1-1r(w) v IIBIIw) 2: 2: 1- 1r(w) v I(I/AIIw, I!BII w)\nthe lemma will be proved. But observe that:\n\u2022 I(l -1r(w)V II A llw,1- 1r(w)V II B llw) = min(I(1-1r(w),1- 1r(w)V II B llw), I( IIA llw' 1- 1r(w) VI!BIIw) = I( IIAIIw,1-7r(w) VIIBIIw) 2: I(ll A IJw , II B l w)\n\u2022 I(1-1r(w)V II A JJw, 1- 1r(w)V II B JJw) 2: 1 - 1r(w)V II B llw2: 1-1r(w)\nThus the above inequality holds and the lemma too. \u2022\nRecall the notion of a maximal elementary conjunction (m.e.c.) of the form /\\7':1 (j;)Pi\u00b7 Let I<= (W, lh 1r) be a possibilistic model and let E be a m.e.c. and A any formula. Then we have the following further lemmas.\nLemma 5.2 There exists a unique j E Values such that for each w E W, w lf-E --+ (j)A.\nProof: Evident for A atomic, induction step clear for connectives as well as for modalities (since the truth value of a m odalized formula is independent of w). \u2022\nLemma 5.3 KJf-(> O)O((j)A A E) --+ (E--+ (j)A)\nProof: If I<IH> O)O((j)AAE) then there is awE W such that 1r(w) A II (j)A A E llw> 0, thus IJ (j)AAE llw= 1, wlf-(j)A A E, so this j is the unique j of Lemma 5.2.

Therefore, the rest of this section is de voted to get the completeness results for our logic as well as the embedding of Q F L2 into M VI< D45 as mentioned before. The techniques are similar to the case of MVS5, i.e. for any formula provable in a com plete theory we can build a possibilistic model where it is satisfiable. First of all we need the following lemma.\nLemma 5. 7 Let T0 be a complete theory such that T0 1- ( i)OC. Then\n(a) (VT \ufffd T0)(VE)(T 1- (E--+ (::; i)(C A OE))),\n(b) (:JT \ufffd T0)(:3E)(T 1- (E A (i)(C A OE))).\nProof: (b - sketch) Assume To 1- (j)OC, j > 0. Then for some E, To 1- (> O)O(E 1\\ (j)(C A OE)). Put D = (E 1\\ (j)(C A OE)). Let To 1- (ir.)DBk , k = 1, ... , n; then To 1- D(ik)DBk and To 1- D/\\\ufffd=t(ik)DBk (note that (ik)DBk is a B-formula!). Since MVKD45 proves OD-+ (DH--+ O(D A H)) for H, D being B-formulas, we get, for H = 1\\(ik)DBk, To 1- OD - O(D A H), thus To 1- (> O)OD -+ (> O)<>(D A H), thus To 1- (> O)O(D A H), and therefore D 1\\ H is consistent3.\n3Recall that a formula A is MV K D45-consistent if MV K D45 fj-.A.\n284 Hajek, Hannancova, Esteva, Garcia, and Godo\nConsequently, D is consistent with the set of all To provable formulas of the form (i)DB, completing this theory we get our T. \u2022\nThis last lemma enables us to define our model as fol lows.\nDefinition 5.8 For each i and C such that To 1- ( i)OC let Tc be a theory T as in (b) in the above lemma. We define the model (W, lh 1r) such that the set of worlds is W ={To} U {Tc I C}; forT E W, the forcing relation is defined by TH-( i)p iff T f- ( i)p, and finally, the possibility distribution is given by 1r(T) = i i!JT r E 1\\ (i)OE.\nCompleteness is obtained by proving next main lemma in a similar way as in lemma 4.12.\nLemma 5.9 For each i, B, and for each T E W, Tlf--Ci)B iff T r (i)B.\nCorollary 5.10 (Completeness) MVKD45 is com plete with respect to the given semantics.\nFinally, QF L2 is related to MVKD45 in the way next theorem shows.\nTheorem 5.11 Define an interpretation of QF L2formulas in MV ]{ D45 by putting (A <l B)* (OA -+ OB) and extending trivially to all QF L2formulas. Then * is a faithful interpretation of Q F L2 in M I<V D45, i.e. a QF L2-formula A is a QF L2tautology iff A* is a MV I< D45-tautology.\n6 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper we have investigated, from a logical point of view, a modality for comparison of possibilities of fuzzy propositions. In this sense, this paper tackles the same problem as in [Hajek & Harmancova, 93] but with another approach. Taking as reference the Zadeh's extension of the concept of possibility mea sures to fuzzy propositions, the corresponding com parative logic QF L2 has been related to two many valued modal systems namely MVS5 and MVKD45, for which complete axiom systems, Hilbert style, have been given. However a number of open questions re main for future investigation. Some of them are listed below.\n(1) It would be desirable to replace axioms (1), (2) of definition 5.6 by some other more elegant axioms (in particular not dealing explicitly with m.e.c.'s). One tautology more similar to the axioms of MVS5 is\n(;?: i)DC ,..... (;?: i)D(;?: i)C.\n(2) Our choice of semantics of DA in MVKD45 might seem unnatural: II DA II= minw((l- 1r(w))V II A llw)- A seemingly\nmore natural choice would be II DA II= minw ( 1r( w )) ---> II A llw) but then to have duality of D and 0 we should have II OA II= maxw(7r & II A llw) (strict conj unction). Unfortunately, for this semantics of D one of the basic axioms of modal logic, namely D(A -+ B) -+ (DA -> DB), is not a tautology. (3) To find an elegant (non-pedestrian) axiomatization of QF L2 in its own language still remains. As a matter of fact, it is worth noticing that some of the axioms of Farinas and Herzig's QP L logic, e.g.\n\u2022 (A<JB) v (B<l A) \u2022 (A <1 B)-+ ((A V C) <1 (B V C)) \u2022 A <1 True \u2022 -.(True <1 False)\nare 1-tautologies of QF L2 too, so they are potential candidates.\n( 4) Furthermore, one should give up the assumption that Values is finite and study the full Lukasiewicz's logic with real values.\n(5) The relationship between the semantics of the com parative modality in [Hajek & Harmancova, 93] and in this present paper it is also a matter of future research.\nAcknowledgements\nFrancese Esteva, Pere Garcia and Lluis Godo have been partially supported by the Esprit III Basic Re serach Action 6156 DRUMS II and by a grant from the Spanish DGICYT (Pr.
