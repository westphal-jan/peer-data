We identify two important properties of metrics, which we call event equivalence and parame\u00ad ter modularity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined, greatly simplify the encoding of a user's prior knowl\u00ad edge. In particular, a user can express his knowledge-for the most part-as a single prior Bayesian network for the domain.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
