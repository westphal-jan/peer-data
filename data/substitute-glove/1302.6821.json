When com\u00ad munication is impossible or expensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition. Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of the possible plans the other agents may be follow\u00ad ing, and develop special techniques for dis\u00ad criminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirable would be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures sup\u00ad porting inference based on uncertain and in\u00ad complete observations. In this paper, we de\u00ad scribe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexible procedural language to observation models represented as proba\u00ad bilistic belief networks.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
