It is formalized in the ATMS framework (each source corresponds to an assumption). We assume then that all sources are indepen\u00ad dent and \"fail\" with a very small probability. This leads to a probability assignment on the set of candidates, or equivalently on the set of consistent environments. This probability assignment induces a Dempster-Shafer belief function which measures the probability that a proposition can be deduced from the evi\u00ad dence. This belief function can be used in several different ways to define a nonmono\u00ad tonic consequence relation. We study ans compare these consequence relations. The case of prioritized knowledge bases is briefly considered.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
