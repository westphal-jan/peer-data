The calculus admits two types of conditioning operators: ordinary Bayes conditioning, P(ylX = x) , which represents the observation X = x, and causal conditioning, P(yldo( X = x)), read the probability of Y = y conditioned on hold\u00ad ing X constant (at x) by deliberate action. Given a mixture of such observational and causal sentences, together with the topology of the causal graph, the calculus derives new conditional probabilities of both types, thus enabling one to quantify the effects of ac\u00ad tions (and policies) from partially specified knowledge bases, such as Bayesian networks in which some conditional probabilities may", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
