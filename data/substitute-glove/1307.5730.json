Generally, users focus more on the minority class and consider the cost of misclassifying a minority class to be more expensive. Unfortunately, most conventional classification algorithms assume that the class distributions are balanced or the misclassification costs are equal. They seek to maximize the overall accuracy which yet cannot distinguish the error types. Therefore, they may neglect the significance of the minority class and tend toward the majority class. Learning in the class imbalance is thus of high importance in data mining and machine learning. From the background of this problem, various meth-\nods are developed within a category called cost-sensitive learning (CSL), such as costs to test [3], to relabel training instances [4], to sample [5], to weight instances [6], and to find a decision threshold [7], [8]. These methods use unequal costs to make a bias toward the minority class. Generally, when the costs are not given, these methods can not work properly. A comprehensive review of learning in the class imbalance problem is provided by He and Garcia [9]. When there exist some uncertainties in the decision,\nit may be better to apply abstaining classification [10] to\n\u2022 X.

Significant benefits have been obtained from abstaining classification, particularly in very critical applications [11], [12]. The optimal rejection thresholds could be found through minimizing a loss function in a cost-sensitive setting [13], [14], [15]. The possibility of designing loss functions for classifiers with a reject option is also explored [16]. In the context of abstaining classifications, the existing CSL approaches require the cost terms associated to the rejects. However, one often fails to provide such information. Up to now, there seems no proper guideline to give the information in terms of the skew ratio. Obviously, a reject option adds another degree of complexity in classifications over the non-abstaining approaches. For advancing the technology and being compatible with human intelligence, we consider the abstaining strategy will become a common option for most learning machines in future. In the class imbalance problem, CSL is an important\nresearch direction. Based on the definition in [17], we extend it below by including the situation of abstaining.\nDefinition 1. Cost-Sensitive Learning (CSL) is a type of learning that takes the misclassification costs and/or rejection costs into consideration. The goal of this type of learning is to minimize the total cost.\nCSL generally requires modelers or users to specify cost terms for reaching the goal. However, this work addresses one open issue which is mostly overlooked: \u201cHow to conduct a learning in the class imbalance problem\nwhen costs are unknown for errors and rejects\u201d? In fact, the issue is not unusual in real-world applica-\ntions. Therefore, we propose another category of learning\n2\nbelow for distinguishing the differences between the present work and the existing studies in CSL.\nDefinition 2. Cost-Free Learning (CFL) is a type of learning that does not require the cost terms associated with the misclassifications and/or rejects as the inputs. The goal of this type of learning is to get optimal classification results without using any cost information.\nIt is understandable that CFL may face a bigger challenge which is shown by the fact that most existing approaches may fail to present reasonable solutions to the open issue. This work attempts to provide an applicable learning strategy in CFL.\nWe extend Hu\u2019s [18] study on mutual information classifiers. While Hu presents the theoretical formulas, no learning approaches and results are shown for the realworld data sets. Hence, this work focuses on learning and presents main contributions as follows.\n\u2022 We propose a CFL strategy in the class imbalance problem. Using normalized mutual information (NI) as the learning target, we conduct the learning from cost-insensitive classifiers. Therefore, we are able to adopt conventional classifiers for simple and direct implementations. The most advantage of this strategy is its unique feature in classification scenarios where one has no knowledge of costs.\n\u2022 We study the relations between the strategy and some existing approaches. First, we derive the \u201cequivalent\u201d costs and the rejection thresholds for binary classifications by using the strategy. The costs, being \u201cobjective\u201d for the reason of purely determined by the distributions of the given data sets, can be a useful reference for \u201csubjective\u201d cost specifications in CSL (Fig. 1). Second, we present graphical interpretations of ROC curve plots for both nonabstaining and abstaining classifiers. From the plots, the intrinsic differences between the strategy and other existing approaches are explained in the cases when one class becomes extremely rare.\n\u2022 We conduct empirical studies on binary class and multi-class problems. Specific investigation is made on abstaining classifications, and we obtain several results from the benchmark data sets which have not been reported before in literature. The results\nconfirm the advantages of the strategy and show the promising perspective of CFL in imbalanced data sets."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "When costs are unequal and unknown, Maloof [20] uses ROC curve to show the performance of binary classifications under different cost settings. The study can be viewed as comparing classifiers rather than finding an optimal operating point. Cost curve [21], [14] can be used to visualize optimal expected costs over a range of cost settings, but it does not suit multi-class problem. Zadrozny and Elkan [22] apply least-squares multiple linear regression to estimate the costs. The method requires cost information of the training sets to be known. Cross validation [23] is proposed to choose from a limited set of cost values, and the final decisions are made by users. There exists some CFL approaches in the class im-\nbalance problem. Various sampling strategies [24], [25], [26] try to modify the imbalanced class distributions. Active learning [27] is also investigated to select desired instances and the feature selection techniques [28], [29] are applied to combat the class imbalance problem for high-dimensional data sets. Besides, ensemble learning methods [30], [31] are used to improve the generalization of predicting the minority class. The recognitionbased methods [32], [33] that train on a single class are proposed as alternatives to the discrimination-based methods to avoid the influence of imbalanced distributions. Sun et al. [34] can get costs for multi-class data sets through maximizing the geometric mean (Gmean) or F-measure which has the ability of balancing the performance of each class. However, all CFL methods above do not take abstaining into consideration and may fail to process the abstaining classifications. In regards to abstaining classification, some strategies\nhave been proposed for defining optimal reject rules. Pietraszek [35] proposes a bounded-abstaintion model with ROC analysis, and Fumera et al. [36] seek to maximize accuracy while keeping the reject rate below a given value. However, the bound information and the targeted reject rate are required to be specified respectively. When there is no prior knowledge of these settings, it is hard to determine the values. Li and Sethi [37] restrict the maximum error rate of each class, but the rates may conflict when they are arbitrarily given."}, {"heading": "1.2 Paper Organization", "text": "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, a brief review of NI is provided.

Finally, we conclude this work in Section 6.\n3"}, {"heading": "2 REVIEW: NORMALIZED MUTUAL INFORMATION", "text": "Normalized mutual information (NI) has been used as an evaluation criterion to measure the degree of dependence between the targets T and the decision outputs Y , and it is denoted as\nNI(T, Y ) = I(T, Y )\nH(T ) ,\nwhere I(T, Y ) is the mutual information of two random variables T and Y , H(T ) is the Shannon\u2019s entropy of T . Note that NI(T, Y ) is in the range [0, 1]. Suppose anm-class abstaining classification, with each\nclass denoted as 1, 2, . . . ,m, and the rejected class denoted as m+1. The value of the target variable T ranges from 1 to m, while the decision output variable Y ranges from 1 to m+ 1. Then we have\nI(T, Y )=\nm \u2211\ni=1\nm+1 \u2211\nj=1\nP (T = i, Y = j) log2 P (T = i, Y = j)\nP (T = i)P (Y = j) ,\nH(T )=\u2212 m \u2211\ni=1\nP (T = i) log2 P (T = i).\nIn general, as the exact probability distribution functions of T and Y are hard to derive, Hu et al. [38] apply empirical estimations to compute NI based on the confusion matrix. Table 1 illustrates an augmented confusion matrix C in anm-class abstaining classification by adding the last column as a rejected class m+1. The rows correspond to the states of the targets T , and the columns correspond to the states of the decision outputs Y . cij represents the number of the instances that belong to the i-th class classified as the j-th class, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, j = 1, 2, . . . ,m + 1. To avoid unchanged value of NI if rejections are made within only one class, the formula of NI is proposed as [38]\nNI(T, Y ) =\nm \u2211\ni=1\nm \u2211\nj=1\nPe(T = i, Y = j) Pe(T=i,Y =j)\nPe(T=i)Pe(Y=j)\n\u2212 m \u2211\ni=1\nPe(T = i) log2 Pe(T = i)\n= \u2212\nm \u2211\ni=1\nm \u2211\nj=1\ncij log2\n\n\ncij\nCi m\u2211\ni=1 (\ncij\nn )\n\n\nm \u2211\ni=1\nCi log2( Ci n )\n, (1)\nwhere Y is counted from 1 to m rather than to m + 1. The subscript \u201ce\u201d is given for denoting empirical terms, Ci = \u2211m+1 j=1 cij is the total number of instances in the i-th class, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, and n = \u2211m\ni=1 \u2211m+1 j=1 cij is the\ntotal number in the confusion matrix. In non-abstaining classification, i.e. classification without rejection, Y ranges from 1 to m and (1) is actually the formula of the original NI. Then (1) is applicable for both non-abstaining and abstaining classifications in the present work. Principe et al. [40] present a schematic diagram of\ninformation theory learning (ITL) and they mention that maximizing mutual information as the target function makes the decision outputs correlate with the targets as much as possible. Recently, a study [18] confirms that ITL opens a new perspective for classifier design. MacKay [39] recommends mutual information for its single rankable value which makes more sense than error rate. Hu et al. [38] study theoretically for the first time on both error types and reject types in binary classifications. They consider information-theoretic measures most promising in providing \u201cobjectivity\u201d to classification evaluations in class imbalance problems. The above viewpoints of mutual information motivate our following NI-based strategy for CFL in the class imbalance problem."}, {"heading": "3 NI-BASED CLASSIFICATION", "text": "In this work, we distinguish two types of classificaitons, namely, \u201cnon-abstaining classification\u201d for no rejection and \u201cabstaining classification\u201d for rejection. From the phenomenon that different error types and reject types produce different effects on NI, one can derive a conclusion that NI considers the costs to be unequal, unlike accuracy. In fact, the cost information is hiding in NI, and we take advantage of its bias toward the minority class. The bias can be changed through moving the decision thresholds, and the value of NI is changed accordingly. We focus our study on the probabilistic classifiers in the present work, although it can also be applied to nonprobabilistic classifiers [19]. Let x = [x1,x2, . . . ,xn]\nT denote a data matrix with n instances to be classified, xl \u2208 R\nd is the input feature vector, l = 1, 2, . . . , n.

Hence, the decision threshold \u03c4 \u2217\u2217\nP of the positive class for making optimal decision is\n\u03c4\u2217\u2217P = \u03b1\u2217N\n1 + \u03b1\u2217N . (12)\nSuppose that the minimum conditional risk rule shares the same decision thresholds with the maximum weighted posterior probability rule, then (11) and (12) should be equal. And we give the following definition:\nDefinition 3. Given the optimal weight \u03b1\u2217N , the \u201cequivalent\u201d misclassification cost is defined as\n\u03bb\u0304FP = \u03b1 \u2217 N . (13)\nIn general, it is assumed that \u03bb\u0304FP < \u03bb\u0304FN , i.e. \u03bb\u0304FP < 1. In this case, it is required that \u03b1\u2217N < 1."}, {"heading": "4.3 Optimal Rejection Thresholds and Costs", "text": "In abstaining binary classification, the relations between the rejection thresholds and the costs can be presented in a form of explicit formulae [18].

This is a preferred feature in processing class imbalance problems [44]. Furthermore, an ROC curve can also provide the graphical interpretations for non-abstaining and abstaining classifications in Fig. 2, where TPR and FPR are true positive rate and false positive rate. We denote A, CR, E and Rej to be accuracy, correct recognition rate, error rate, and reject rate, respectively. CN and CP are the total numbers of the negatives and positives, respectively. CFN , CFP , CTN , CTP , CRN and CRP are the numbers of the false negatives, false positives, true negatives, true positives, reject negatives, and reject positives, respectively. Their relations are shown as follows: Non-abstaining:\nAN + EN = 1, and AP + EP = 1, AN = CTN\nCN , EN =\nCFP\nCN , AP =\nCTP\nCP , EP =\nCFN\nCP ; (15a)\nAbstaining:\nCRN + EN +RejN = 1, and CRP + EP +RejP = 1, CRN = CTN\nCN , EN =\nCFP\nCN , RejN =\nCRN\nCN ,\nCRP = CTP\nCP , EP =\nCFN\nCP , RejP =\nCRP\nCP . (15b)\nSeveral observations are summarized below for understanding the features of ROC plots. To begin with, we discuss an ROC curve in a non-abstaining classification, as shown in Fig. 2a. For a theoretical ROC curve which is concave, the decision is made by K, the slope of ROC curve, in the form of [45]:\nK = p(N)\np(P) \u03bbFP \u2212 \u03bbTN \u03bbFN \u2212 \u03bbTP = p(N) p(P) \u03bb\u0304FP , (16)\nwhich is also equivalent to the likelihood ratio [46]:\nL = p(x|P)\np(x|N) =\np(N)\np(P) \u03bbFP \u2212 \u03bbTN \u03bbFN \u2212 \u03bbTP = p(N) p(P) \u03bb\u0304FP . (17)\nFrom (16), one can observe that:\nif p(P) \u2192 0, then K \u2192 \u221e, (18a)\nand EP = 1, AP = 0, EN = 0, AN = 1, (18b)\nfor general cost terms. (18a) indicates that the tangent point on the ROC curve will be located at the origin in Fig. 2a, and (18b) demonstrates a graphical interpretation why conventional classifiers fail to process minority class (herein the positive class) properly. However, the situation in (18) can never appear from using the present strategy, because it will result in a zero value of mutual information [39], [43]. Different with the non-abstaining classification, Fig.\n2b shows the abstaining classification graphically on an ROC curve. Two abstaining slopes, KN and KP , are generally given in the forms of [15]:\nKN = p(N)\np(P ) \u03bbRN \u2212 \u03bbTN \u03bbFN \u2212 \u03bbRP = p(N) p(P ) \u03bb\u0304RN 1\u2212 \u03bb\u0304RP ,\nKP = p(N)\np(P ) \u03bbFP \u2212 \u03bbRN \u03bbRP \u2212 \u03bbTP = p(N) p(P ) \u03bb\u0304FP \u2212 \u03bb\u0304RN \u03bb\u0304RP . (19)\n7\n(#Inst: number of instances, #Attr: number of attributes, #C: number of classes)\nWhenever KN 6= KP , one can observe the non-zero results of rejection rates. (19) confirms the finding in [18] that at most two independent parameters will determine the rejection range in binary classifications. Sometimes, one can still apply a single independent parameter, such as KP = 2KN , for abstaining decisions. There exist relations between rejection thresholds in\nthe posterior curve plot [18] and abstaining slopes in the ROC curve plot. Their relations and the associated constraint are derived from [18]:\nKN = p(N)\np(P )\nTrN\n1\u2212 TrN , KP =\np(N)\np(P ) 1\u2212 TrP TrP ,\nKN < KP .

On Pageblock, the maximum ratio between the majority class and the minority class is 175. Most of the data sets are obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository1, Ism is from [25], Rooftop is from [20], and Phoneme is from KEEL Datasets2. All of them have continuous attributes and are rescaled to be in the range [0, 1]. We perform 3-fold cross validation and all experiments are repeated ten times to get the average results. In addition, Table 3 lists the procedure of our NI based experiments for each run. We call our NI based non-abstaining classification\nand NI based abstaining classification \u201cNI no rej\u201d and \u201cNI rej\u201d respectively. To illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy, we adopt kNN and Bayes classifier as the conventional classifiers, and we compare our methods with SMOTE, Cost-sensitive learning, Chow\u2019s reject [10] methods and the G-mean based methods (\u201cGmean no rej\u201d and \u201cGmean rej\u201d) besides two conventional classifications. In kNN classifier, we apply Euclidean distance and\nuse the confidence values [47], [19] as the probabilistic\n1. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ 2. http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/datasets.php\noutputs. The class assignment is decided by the highest confidence. For brevity, we just list the results of 11- NN on all data sets except 5-NN on Pageblock. In Bayes classifier, we derive the estimated class-conditional density from the Parzen-window estimation with Gaussian kernel [48] and apply Bayes rule to classification. The smooth parameter is chosen as the average value of the distance from one instance to its rth nearest neighborhood (r=10 empirically), and the empirical probability of the occurrence of class is chosen as the prior probability. In SMOTE, the average results are presented with the amount from 1 to 5, and it performs simultaneously on the minority classes of the multi-class data sets with the same amount. In Cost-sensitive learning, we simply assign the inverse of the class distribution ratio to the misclassification cost \u03bbij for i 6=j, and \u03bbii=0. We do not consider abstaining for it because the rejection costs would be hard to give. In Chow\u2019s reject, we simply assign 0.3 to the rejection thresholds for all classes.

Cost-sensitive learning performs well under the current cost settings, but its accuracy is the lowest when the class distribution differs greatly. On Nursery and Letter, the error rate of the positive class is zero with Cost-sensitive learning at the price of high error rate of the negative class.

But it is difficult to decide the rejection costs and the rejection thresholds for lack of information about the rejections. Regarding to Chow\u2019s reject, it is usually wasteful to reject lots of instances from the positive class with arbitrary settings on the rejection thresholds. On most data sets, Gmean rej achieves the highest accuracy and the lowest error rate of the positive class, at the price of considerably high reject rate. However, the accuracy of Gmean rej is lower than the conventional classifications on Ism and Rooftop. One explanation is that the goal of the G-mean based methods is to maximize the geometric mean of the accuracy within each class rather than the total accuracy. Compared with Gmean rej and Chow\u2019s reject, our NI rej performs best on the whole with low error rate of the positive class, high accuracy, a certain amount of reject rate, high G-mean, high F-measure and the highest NI.\nTable 5 lists the values of the optimal weight \u03b1\u2217N and rejection thresholds T \u2217r . The last two columns represent the \u201cequivalent\u201d rejection costs computed with the mean values of \u03b1\u2217N and T \u2217\nr . Moreover, these values are purely determined by the data sets besides the conventional classification algorithms. They can be adopted as \u201cobjective\u201d references while the cost information is unknown. In addition, the \u201cequivalent\u201d costs of these data sets are consistent with human assumption, which also reflects the effectiveness of our NI based strategy.\nFig. 3 shows the ROC convex hull (ROCCH) of kNN for Diabetes generated from 90 validation sets by threshold averaging [44]. We just list some of the vertices in Table 6. And we use them to approximatively locate the parameters [15]. In Fig. 3a, we use equal and \u201cequivalent\u201d misclassification costs to compute the slopes, respectively. The slopes computed with costs are the same as those computed with rejection thresholds on ROCCH, so we only plot the latter in Fig. 3b. Point B in Fig. 3a lies between D and F. Due to approximation, points D and F that the slopes find are not cohere with the optimal\nthreshold points C and E. In addition, the parameters can be adjusted with the graphical interpretations in Fig. 2 under the property P3 by the users."}, {"heading": "5.4 Multi-Class Tasks", "text": "The detailed results on the multi-class data sets are shown from Table 7 to Table 9, including the performance evaluations and the values of the optimal parameters. Compared with the conventional classifications that have high error rates of the minority classes, SMOTE is effective in reducing these errors. Cost-sensitive learning classifies all instances to the class that has the minimum number of instances. Both Gmean no rej and NI no rej perform well with low error rates of the minority classes, high G-mean and high NI. Chow\u2019s reject and Gmean rej reject lots of instances from the minority classes; besides, Gmean rej rejects lots of instances from the majority class. On the whole, our NI rej performs best with low error rates of the minority classes, a certain amount of reject rate, high G-mean, and the highest NI. In summary, the observations above suggest that:\n12\n(a) Evaluation of the methods, \u201c\u2013\u201d: not available, the best performance in each cell is bolded. (b) Optimal weights and rejection thresholds are listed as mean(standard deviation).\n1. Within the CFL category, both SMOTE and G-mean based methods are effective in the class imbalance problem. However, they are unable to process abstaining classifications.\n2. Regarding to Cost-sensitive learning, it is feasible to apply the inverses of the class distribution ratios as the misclassification costs on binary class tasks. But on multi-class tasks, it may be ineffective. Moreover, the rejection costs are always hard to get.\n3. Chow\u2019s reject would perform poorly if the rejection thresholds are arbitrarily given.\n4. NI based strategy is a good choice for both nonabstaining and abstaining classifications. It can produce reasonable solutions on the minority classes."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we propose a new strategy of CFL to deal with the class imbalance problem. Based on the specific property of mutual information that can distinguish different error types and reject types, we seek to maximize it as a general rule for dealing with binary/multiclass classifications with/without abstaining. A unique feature is gained in abstaining classifications when information is unknown about errors and rejects. To our best knowledge, no other existing approach is applicable to this scenario. Moreover, we can derive the \u201cequivalent\u201d costs for binary classifications. Generally, the \u201cequivalent\u201d costs will be changed accordingly to the distributions of the given data sets. Therefore, the present strategy provides an \u201cobjective\u201d reference for CSL if users want\n13\n(a) Evaluation of the methods, \u201c\u2013\u201d: not available, the best performance in each cell is bolded. (b) Optimal weights and rejection thresholds are listed as mean(standard deviation).\nto adjust the costs. For better understanding ROC curves in binary classifications, graphical interpretations of the theoretical ROC curve plots are explained in terms of the related parameters, such as cost terms and rejection thresholds. Empirical study confirms the advantages of the proposed strategy in solving class imbalance problems. At the same time, we recognize the disadvantage of the work that it will add an extra computational cost over the existing approaches. This difficulty will form a future work for advancing the study."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This work is supported in part by NSFC (No. 61075051) and the SPRP-CAS (No. XDA06030300)."}], "references": [{"title": "The Class Imbalance Problem: A Systematic Study", "author": ["N.

cost-sensitive learning (CSL). The main difference between them is that a CFL approach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost information, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL approaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some criteria-based approaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing CFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications properly when no information is given about errors and rejects. Based on information theory, we propose a novel CFL which seeks to maximize normalized mutual information of the targets and the decision outputs of classifiers. Using the strategy, we can deal with binary/multi-class classifications with/without abstaining. Significant features are observed from the new strategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed strategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and automatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving optimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the \u201cequivalent\u201d costs in binary classifications. The connection between rejection thresholds and ROC curve is explored. Empirical investigation is made on several benchmark data sets in comparison with other existing approaches. The classification results demonstrate a promising perspective of the strategy in machine learning.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
