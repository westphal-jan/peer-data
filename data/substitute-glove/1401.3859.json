Introduction", "text": "Information about the preferences, activities, and demographic attributes of people using online applications can be leveraged to personalize the services for individuals and groups of users. For example, knowledge about the current locations of users performing web searches can help identify their informational goals. Researchers and organizations have pursued explicit and implicit methods for personalizing online services. For web search, explicit personalization methods rely on users indicating sets of topics of interest that are stored on a server or client. Implicit methods make use of information collected in the absence of user effort and awareness. Data collected implicitly in web search can include users locations and search activities, capturing such information as how people specify and reformulate queries and click, dwell, and navigate on results. Beyond web search, data collected about users in an implicit manner can be used to custom-tailor the behaviors of a broad spectrum of online applications from informational services like news summarizers to\nc\u00a92010 AI Access Foundation.

Both users and the hosts of online applications may benefit from the custom-tailoring of services. However, both may be uncomfortable with the access and use of personal information. There has been increasing discussion about incursions into the privacy of users implied by the general logging and storing of online data (Adar, 2007). Beyond general anxieties with sharing personal information, people may more specifically have concerns about becoming increasingly identifiable; as increasing amounts of personal data are acquired, users become members of increasingly smaller groups of people associated with the same attributes.\nMost work to date on personalizing online services has either ignored the challenges of privacy and focused efforts solely on maximizing utility (c.f., Sugiyama, Hatano, & Ikoma, 2004) or has completely bypassed the use of personal data. One vein of research has explored the feasibility of personalizing services with methods that restrict the collection and analysis of personal data to users own computing devices (Horvitz, 2006). Research in this realm includes efforts to personalize web search by making use of the content stored on local machines, as captured within the index of a desktop search service (Teevan, Dumais, & Horvitz, 2005; Xu, Zhang, & Wang, 2007). Rather than cut off opportunities to make personal data available for enhancing online services or limit personalization to client-side analyses, we introduce and study utility-theoretic methods that balance the costs of sharing of personal data with online services in return for the benefits of personalization. Such a decision-theoretic perspective on privacy can allow systems to weigh the benefits of enhancements that come with adaptation with the costs of sensing and storage according to users preferences.\nWe characterize the utility of sharing attributes of private data via value-of-information analyses that take into consideration the preferences to users about the sharing of personal information. We explicitly quantify preferences about utility and privacy and then solve an optimization problem to find the best trade. Our approach is based on two fundamental observations. The first is that, for practical applications, the utility gained with sharing of personal data may often have a diminishing returns property; acquiring more information about a user adds decreasing amounts to the utility of personalization given what is already known about the users needs or intentions. On the contrary, the more information that is acquired about a user, the more concerning the breach of privacy becomes. For example, a set of individually non-identifying pieces of information may, when combined, hone down the user to membership in a small group, or even identify an individual. We map the properties of diminishing returns on utility and the concomitant accelerating costs of revelation to the combinatorial concepts of submodularity and supermodularity, respectively.\nAlthough the economic perspective on privacy is relevant to a wide spectrum of applications, and to studies of the foundations of privacy more broadly, we shall illustrate the concepts in application to personalizing web search. We employ a probabilistic model to predict the web page that a searcher is going to visit given the search query and attributes describing the user. We define the utility of a set of personal attributes by the focusing power of the information gained with respect to the prediction task. Similarly, we use the same probabilistic model to quantify the risk of identifying users given a set of personal attributes. We then combine the utility and cost functions into a single objective function, which we use to find a small set of attributes which maximally increases the likelihood of predicting the target website, while making identification of the user as\ndifficult as possible. The challenges of this optimization are in identifying the benefits and costs of sharing information and grappling with the computational hardness of the analysis. Solving for the best set of attributes for users to reveal (and hence for the optimal setting of the utility-privacy tradeoff) is an NP-hard search problem, and thus intractable in general for large sets of attributes. We shall demonstrate how we can use the submodularity of the utility and supermodularity of privacy in order to find a near-optimal tradeoff efficiently. To our knowledge, no existing approach (such as LeFevre, DeWitt, & Ramakrishnan, 2006; Chen, LeFevre, & Ramakrishnan, 2007; Hore & R. Jammalamadaka, 2007) provides such theoretical guarantees. We evaluate our approach on realworld search log data, as well as from data collected from a user study with over 1,400 participants focused on the elicitation of preferences about sharing sensitive information. Our results indicate the existence of prominent \u201csweet spots\u201d in the utility-privacy tradeoff curve, at which most of the utility can be achieved with the sharing of a minimal amount of private information.\nThe manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formalize the utility-privacy tradeoff as an optimization problem and introduce objective functions. Section 3 identifies the submodular and supermodular structure of the utility and cost functions. In Section 4, we introduce an algorithm for finding a near-optimal solution, which exploits this combinatorial structure. In Section 6, we describe the experimental design of our user study. Section 5 describes the experimental setup, and Section 7 presents empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world search data. Section 8 presents related work. Section 9 reviews approaches to deploying the methodology described in this paper, and Section 10 presents a summary and conclusions."}, {"heading": "2. Privacy-Aware Personalization", "text": "We consider the challenge of personalization as diagnosis under uncertainty: We seek to predict a searcher\u2019s information goals, given such noisy clues as query terms and potentially additional attributes that describe users and their interests and activities. We frame the challenge probabilistically (as done, e.g., in Dou, Song, & Wen, 2007; Downey, Dumais, & Horvitz, 2007 in the search context), by modeling a joint distribution P over random variables, which comprise the target intention X , some request-specific attributes (e.g., the query term) Q, the identity of the user Y , and several attributes V = {V1, V2, . . . , Vm} containing private information. Such attributes include user-specific variables (such as demographic information, search history, word frequencies on the local machine, etc.) and request-specific variables (such as the period of time since an identical query was submitted). We describe the concrete attributes used in this work for the web search context in Section 5. Additional examples are described by Downey et al. (2007) and Teevan et al. (2005). We shall describe the use of statistical techniques to learn a predictive model P from training data for frequent queries. Then, we present methods for trading off utility and privacy in the context of the model."}, {"heading": "2.1 Utility of Accessing Private Data", "text": "Upon receiving a new request Q, and given a subset A \u2286 V of the attributes, we can use the probabilistic model to predict the target intention by performing inference, computing the conditional distribution P (X | Q,A). Then, we use this distribution to inform the decision of, e.g., which search results to present to the user. We use the notation #intents to refer to the domain size of X (e.g., the maximum number of different webpages clicked on by the users). The hope in personalization is that additional knowledge about the user (i.e., the observed set of attributesA) will help to simplify the prediction task, via reducing the uncertainty in P (X | Q,A). Based on this intuition,\nwe quantify the uncertainty in our prediction using the conditional Shannon entropy (c.f., Cover & Thomas, 1991) associated with the variance in target web sites following queries,\nH(X | Q,A) = \u2212 \u2211 x,q,a P (x, q,a) log2 P (x | q,a).\nHence, for any subset A \u2286 V , we define its utility U(A) to be the information gain, i.e., expected entropy reduction achieved by observing A:\nU(A) = H(X | Q)\u2212H(X | Q,A) = \u2212 \u2211 x,q,a P (x, q,a) [log2 P (x | q)\u2212 log2 P (x | q,a)] .\nSuch click entropy has been previously been found effective by Dou et al. (2007)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Cost of Sharing Private Data", "text": "Several different models of privacy have been proposed in prior work (c.f., Sweeney, 2002; Machanavajjhala, Kifer, Gehrke, & Venkitasubramaniam, 2006; Dwork, 2006). Our cost function is motivated by the consideration that sets of attributesA \u2286 V should be preferred that make identification of individuals as difficult as possible. We can consider the observed attributesA as noisy observations of the (unobserved) identity Y = y of the user. Intuitively, we want to associate high cost C(A) with sets A which allow accurate prediction of Y given A, and low cost for sets A for which the conditional distributions P (Y | A) are highly uncertain. For a distribution P (Y ) over users, we hence define an identifiability loss function L(P (Y )) which maps probability distributions over users Y to the real numbers. L is chosen in a way, such that if there exists a user y such that P (Y = y) is close to 1, then the loss L(P (Y )) is very large. If P (Y ) is the uniform distribution, then L(P (Y )) is close to 0. We will explore different loss functions L below. Based on such loss functions, we define the identifiability cost I(A) as the expected loss of the conditional distributions P (Y | A = a), where the expectation is taken over the observations A = a1:\nI(A) = \u2211 a P (a)L(P (Y | A = a)).\nIn addition to identifiability, we introduce an additional additive cost component S(A) =\u2211 a\u2208A s(a), where s(a) \u2265 0 is a nonnegative quantity modeling the subjective sensitivity of attribute a, and other additive costs, such as data acquisition cost, etc. The final cost function C(A) is a combination of the identifiability cost I(A) and sensitivity S(A), i.e., C(A) = I(A) + S(A)."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 IDENTIFIABILITY LOSS FUNCTIONS", "text": "There are several ways to quantify identifiability. One approach to representing the loss L is with the negative entropy of the distribution P (Y ) of the user\u2019s identity Y 2, as used to quantify utility. However, in the context of privacy, this choice is rather poor: Consider a case where we seek to quantify the cost associated with the change in identifiability of the user that comes with learning\n1. Similarly, we can additionally take the expectation over the request Q 2. Note that instead of the user\u2019s identity (composed of all attribute values) in principle Y could refer to a particular\nsensitive attribute (such as, e.g., sexual orientation).\nthe searchers gender. Assuming an equal distribution of males and females, learning the gender of the searcher would halve the space of possible searchers, hence increasing the entropy loss by one. However, this increase is independent of whether we start with (a) one billion or (b) only two searchers. In contrast to the influence on utility, where halving the search space of pages to consider is a very large gain, independent of the number of pages we start with (Dou et al., 2007), such a diminishment of anonymity is enormous: In case (a), an adversary trying to identify the searcher based on knowing their gender has almost no chance of success, whereas in case (b) they would always identify the person. Motivated by this consideration, we represent the privacy cost in our experiments as the maxprob loss (Chen et al., 2007), Lm(P (Y )) = maxy P (y). This loss function can be interpreted as follows: An adversary seeks to identify the user Y , and predicts the most likely user, and receives one unit reward if the user is guessed correctly, and 0 otherwise. The identifiability cost\nIm(A) = \u2211 a P (a) max y (P (y | A = a))\nthen is the expected win obtained by the adversary. This objective function makes most sense if we believe the adversary only has access to the same data sources as we do (and thus the probability distribution P captures the assumptions about the adversary\u2019s inferences). We also consider the cost function\nI`(A) = \u2212 \u2211 a P (a) log ( 1\u2212max y (P (y | A = a)) ) .\nI` is a \u201crescaled\u201d variant of the maxprob loss, with the property that certainty (i.e., maxy(P (y | A = a) \u2248 1) is more severely penalized.\nAnother criterion for identifiability is k-anonymity (Sweeney, 2002). With this measure, a data set is called k-anonymous, if any combination of attributes is matched by at least k people. We can define a probabilistic notion of k-anonymity, Ik, by using the loss function Lk(P (Y )) which is 1 if P is nonzero for less than k values of Y , 0 otherwise. The identifiability cost is then\nIk(A) = \u2211 a P (a)Lk(P (Y | A = a)).\nIk(A) can be interpreted as the expected number of violations of k-anonymity; a database (empirical distribution over users) is k-anonymous if and only if Ik(A) = 0. See Lebanon, Scannapieco, Fouad, and Bertino (2009) for a justification of using a decision-theoretic analysis to quantify privacy and how inferential attacks through side information can be handled.\nWe experimentally compare the cost metrics in Section 7.1."}, {"heading": "2.3 Optimizing the Utility-Privacy Tradeoff", "text": "Previously, we described how we can quantify the utility U(A) for any given set of attributes A, and its associated privacy cost C(A). Our goal is to find a set A, for which U(A) is as large as possible, while keeping C(A) as small as possible. To optimize utility for users under this tradeoff, we use scalarization (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004), and define a new, scalar objective\nF\u03bb(A) = U(A)\u2212 \u03bbC(A).\nHereby, \u03bb plays the role of a privacy-to-utility conversion factor. The goal is to solve the following optimization problem:\nA\u2217\u03bb = argmax A F\u03bb(A) (2.1)\nBy varying \u03bb, we can find different solutionsA\u2217\u03bb. If we choose a very small \u03bb, we find solutions with higher utility and higher cost; large values of \u03bb will lead to lower utility, but also lower privacy cost.\nIf the set of attributes V is large, then (2.1) is a difficult search problem, as the number of subsets A grows exponentially in the size of V . It can be shown that the solution to this problem is hard even to approximate:\nTheorem 2.1. If there is a constant \u03b1 > (1\u22121/e) and there exists an algorithm which is guaranteed to find a set A\u2032 such that F1(A\u2032) \u2265 \u03b1maxA F1(A), then P = NP .\nThe proofs of all theorems are presented in the Appendix. Given the complexity, we cannot expect to find a solution A\u2217 efficiently which achieves even slightly more than (1\u2212 1/e) \u2248 63% of the optimal score. However, we can find a solution which is guaranteed to achieve at least 1/3 of the optimal value."}, {"heading": "2.4 Hard Constraints on Privacy Cost", "text": "Instead of optimizing the tradeoff F\u03bb(A) = U(A)\u2212 \u03bbC(A), one may be interested in maximizing the utility U(A) subject to a hard constraint on the cost C(A), i.e., solve\nA\u2217\u03bb = argmax A U(A) s.t. C(A) \u2264 B, (2.2)\nfor some value of B \u2265 0. For example, users may be interested in maximizing utility while enforcing k-anonymity (in which case we would constrain Ik(A) \u2264 0). This solution would then provide per-user guarantees, i.e., k-anonymity is never violated. In principle, one could solve the tradeoff F\u03bb (i.e., problem (2.1)) for different values of \u03bb and then, e.g., using binary search, choose \u03bb that maximizes U(A) among all feasible solutions (i.e., C(A) \u2264 B). In a sense, (2.1) can be seen as a Lagrangian relaxation of (2.2).\nIn the following, we will focus on the tradeoff problem (2.1). Using the procedure described above, our approach may be useful to solve the constrained problem (2.2) in practice (however our approximation guarantees will only hold for problem (2.1))."}, {"heading": "3. Properties of the Utility-Privacy Tradeoff", "text": "As mentioned above, we would expect intuitively that the more information we already have about a user (i.e., the larger |A|), the less the observation of a new, previously unobserved, attribute would help with enhancing a service. The combinatorial notion of submodularity formally captures this intuition. A set functionG : 2V \u2192 R mapping subsetsA \u2286 V into the real numbers is called submodular (Nemhauser, Wolsey, & Fisher, 1978), if for allA \u2286 B \u2286 V , and V \u2032 \u2208 V\\B, it holds thatG(A\u222a {V \u2032})\u2212G(A) \u2265 G(B \u222a {V \u2032} \u2212G(B), i.e., adding V \u2032 to a set A increases G more than adding V \u2032 to a superset B of A. G is called nondecreasing, if for all A \u2286 B \u2286 V it holds that G(A) \u2264 G(B).\nA result of Krause and Guestrin (2005) shows that, under certain common conditional independence conditions, the reduction in click entropy is submodular and nondecreasing:\nTheorem 3.1 (Krause & Guestrin, 2005). If the attributes V are conditionally independent given X , i.e., P (V1, . . . , Vm | X) = \u220f i P (Vi | X) then U(A) is submodular in A.\nWe discussed earlier how we expect the privacy cost to behave differently: Adding a new attribute would likely make a stronger incursion into personal privacy when we know a great deal about a user, and less if we know little. This \u201cincreasing costs\u201d property corresponds with the combinatorial notion of supermodularity: A set functionG : 2V \u2192 R is called supermodular (Nemhauser et al., 1978), if for all A \u2286 B \u2286 V , and V \u2032 \u2208 V \\ V , it holds that G(A \u222a {V \u2032}) \u2212 G(A) \u2264 G(B \u222a {V \u2032} \u2212 G(B), i.e., adding V \u2032 to a large set B increases G more than adding V \u2032 to a subset A of B. In fact, we can prove that the maxprob identifiability cost function introduced in Section 2 is supermodular.\nTheorem 3.2. Assume, the attributes V are marginally independent, and the user Y is completely characterized by the attributes, i.e., Y = (V). Then the maxprob loss Im(A) is supermodular inA.\nNote that the attribute sensitivity S(A) is per definition additive and hence supermodular as well. Thus, as a positive linear combination of supermodular functions, C(A) = I(A) + S(A) is supermodular inA for I(A) = Im(A). In our empirical evaluation, we verify the submodularity of U(A) and supermodularity C(A) even without the assumptions made by Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2.\nMotivated by the above insights about the combinatorial properties of utility and privacy, we formulate a general approach to trading off utility and privacy. We only assume that the utility U(A) is a submodular set function, and that C(A) is a supermodular set function. We define the general utility-privacy tradeoff problem as follows:\nProblem 3.3. Given a set V of possible attributes to select, a nondecreasing submodular utility function U(A), a nondecreasing supermodular cost function C(A), and a constant \u03bb \u2265 0, our goal is to find a set A\u2217 such that\nA\u2217 = argmax A F\u03bb(A) = argmax A U(A)\u2212 \u03bbC(A) (3.1)\nSince C(A) is supermodular if and only if \u2212C(A) is submodular, and since nonnegative linear combinations of submodular set functions are submodular as well, the scalarized objective F\u03bb(A) = U(A) \u2212 \u03bbC(A) is submodular as well. Hence, problem (3.1) requires the maximization of a submodular set function."}, {"heading": "4. Optimization Algorithms", "text": "As the number of subsets A \u2286 V grows exponentially with the size n of V , and the NP-hardness of Problem (2.1), we cannot expect to find the optimal solutionA\u2217 efficiently. Theorem 2.1 shows that it is NP-hard to even approximate the optimal solution to better than a constant factor of (1\u22121/e). A fundamental result by Nemhauser et al. (1978) characterized the performance of the simple greedy algorithm, which starts with the empty setA = \u2205 and myopically adds the attribute which increases the score the most, i.e., A \u2190 A \u222a {argmaxV \u2032 F (A \u222a {V \u2032})}, until k elements have been selected (where k is a specified constant). It was shown that, if F is nondecreasing, submodular and F (\u2205) = 0, then the greedy solution AG satisfies F (AG) \u2265 (1\u2212 1/e) max|A|=k F (A), i.e., the greedy solution achieves a value of at least a factor of 1\u22121/e of the optimal solution. Although this result would allow us to perform such tasks as selecting a near-optimal set of k private attributes maximizing the\nutility U(A) (which satisfies the conditions of the result from Nemhauser et al., 1978), it unfortunately does not apply in the more general case, where the objective F\u03bb(A) is not nondecreasing.\nThe problem of maximizing such non-monotone submodular functions has been resolved by Feige, Mirrokni, and Vondrak (2007). A local search algorithm, named LS, was proved to guarantee a near-optimal solutionALS , if F is a nonnegative3 (but not necessarily nondecreasing) submodular function:\n1.

Return ALS \u2190 argmax{F (A), F (V \\ A)}.\nThis algorithm works in an iterative manner to add or remove an element V \u2032 in order to increase the score, until no further improvement can be achieved.

In our implementation, we select in a greedy manner the element V \u2032 which most increases the objective function. Furthermore, to speed up computation, we use lazy evaluation to find the greedy elements (Robertazzi & Schwartz, 1989).\nThe algorithm LLS (c.f., Figure 1) performs a sequence of upwards and downwards passes, adding and removing elements which improve F\u03bb by at least a factor of (1+ \u03b5n2 ). The upwards pass is done in a lazy manner\u2014the increments \u03b4V are lazily updated only when necessary. We found that the lazy computation can reduce the running time by an order of magnitude. The correctness of this lazy procedure follows directly from submodularity: Submodularity implies that the \u03b4V are monotonically nonincreasing as more and more elements are added toA. The lazy updates can also be applied for the greedy downward pass. We discovered that Algorithm 1 usually terminates after one single downwards pass, without removing a single element.\n3.

The Hoeffding inequality allows us to acquire bounds on the number of samples needed in order to determine the expectation E[H\u0302] of a random variable H\u0302 , if H\u0302 is bounded. In the case of click entropy reduction, we use the random variable\nH\u0302 | [Q = q,A = a] = H(X)\u2212H(X | q,a).\nH\u0302 is a deterministic function modeling the click entropy reduction if request Q = q and attributes A = a are observed.

Our survey was designed specifically to probe preferences about revealing different attributes of private data in return for increases in the utility of a service (in this case, in terms of enhanced search efficiency).

(2005) show, willingness to share information greatly depends on the type of information being shared, with whom the information is shared, and how the information is going to be used. In designing the survey, we tried to be as specific as possible, by specifying a low-risk situation, in which the \u201cpersonal information would be shared and used only with respect to a single specified query, and discarded immediately thereafter.\u201d Our survey contained questions both on the sensitivity of individual attributes and on concerns about identifiability.

Also, the sharing rates are very similar to those estimated in the survey (78% for gender, 82% for age, and 64% for occupation). The least willingness to share (54.4% and 52.6% respectively) was exhibited for marital status (DMTL) and whether the participant has children (DCHD), closely followed by occupation (63.9%). Most participants (92.7%) would rather share their region than share that their interests include news-related webpages (TNWS). Figure 1 presents the results for this question. We also asked the participants to classify the sensitivity of the attributes on a Likert scale from 1 (not very sensitive) to 5 (highly sensitive). The order of the questions was randomized. Figure 2 presents the results. The frequency of search engine usage (AFRQ) as well as very general topic interests, e.g., in news pages (TNWS), are considered to be of low sensitivity. Interestingly, we found that there are significant differences in preferences among participants even for sharing with a service interests in different topics; participants showed significantly greater sensitivity to sharing their interest in health or society related websites (THEA, TSOC) than in news or science-related pages (TNWS, TSCI). The biggest \u201cjump\u201d in sensitivity occurs between attributes ACLK, referring to sharing a repeated visit to same website, and ACRY, referring to having recently traveled internationally.

Similarly, we asked how sensitive participants would be to sharing their location at the region, country, state, city, zip code, or address levels of detail. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) present the mean sensitivity with 95% confidence intervals for this experiment. We also assessed participants sensitivities to having their search activity stored in different ways. More specifically, we asked users to assess their sensitivity about storing only a topic classification of the visited websites (i.e., whether a news- , business-, health-related etc. site was visited), storing all searches for 1 or 3 years, or storing all searches indefinitely. Lastly, we asked the participants how sensitive they would be, if, in spite of sharing the information, they would be guaranteed to remain indistinguishable from at least k other people (thereby eliciting preferences about k of kanonymity). Here, we varied k among 1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000 and 1 million.

First, storing search activity is generally considered more sensitive than sharing certain demographic information. For example, even storing only the topic classification of visited web pages is considered significantly more sensitive than sharing the city or birth year of a user. This result indicates that logging search activity is considered at least as threatening to privacy as sharing certain demographic information.

Results", "text": "We now describe our empirical results on calibrating and optimizing the utility-privacy tradeoff."}, {"heading": "7.1 Computing Utility and Cost", "text": "We use the empirical distribution of the data described in Section 5, and evaluate utility and cost by sampling. Each sample is a row picked uniformly at random from the search logs. We then find all queries matching the selected attributes (A = a), and compute the conditional entropy of the click distribution, as well as the identifiability loss function. In order to avoid overfitting with sparse data,\nwe applied Dirichlet smoothing. In our experiments, we use 1000 independent samples in order to estimate U(A) and I(A).\nWe first apply the greedy algorithm to select an increasing number of attributes, maximizing the utility and ignoring the cost. Figure 6 presents the greedy ordering and the achieved entropy reductions. The greedy algorithm selects the attributes DOCC, ATLV, DAGE, ACTY, AQRY, ACLK, AWHR, TADT, AWDY, THOM, TCIN, DGDR, TGMS, TREG, in this order. After selecting these attributes, the utility does not increase significantly anymore. The entropy reduction levels off at roughly 1.92 bits. Figure 6 underscores the diminishing-returns property of click entropy reduction.\nSimilarly, we generate a greedy ordering of the attributes, in order of minimum incremental cost. Figure 7 presents the results of this experiment, using the maxprob cost metric. As expected, the curve looks convex (apart from small variations due to the sampling process). The cost initially increases very slowly, and the growth increases as more attributes are selected. This behavior empirically corroborates the supermodularity assumption for the cost metric.\nFigure 9 compares the three cost metrics, as more and more attributes are selected. All three metrics initially behave qualitatively similarly. However, the k-anonymity metric flattens out after 25 out of 31 attributes have been selected. This is expected, as eventually enough personal information is available in order to (almost) always reduce the candidate set of people to less than k = 100. At this point, adding more attributes will not dramatically increase the cost anymore. However, when trading off utility and privacy, one is interested in solutions with small cost, and in this critical region, the cost function behaves supermodularly as well."}, {"heading": "7.2 Calibrating the Tradeoff with Assessed Preferences", "text": "We now use the scalarization (3.1) to trade off utility and cost. For this optimization, we need to choose the tradeoff parameter \u03bb. Instead of committing to a single value of \u03bb, we generate solutions for increasing values of \u03bb. For each such value, we use LLS to find an approximate solution, and plot its utility and cost. Figure 8(a) shows the tradeoff curve obtained from this experiment. We can see that this curve exhibits a prominent knee: For values 1 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 10, small increases of the utility\nlead of big increases in cost, and vice versa. Hence, at the knee, we can achieve near-maximal utility at near-minimum cost.\nTo integrate peoples\u2019 preference in the analysis of the tradeoff, we perform the following calibration procedure. From the search log data, we determined how increasing the resolution of a person\u2019s location increases the privacy cost. We vary the location granularity from region (coarsest) to zip code (finest). For example, we compute the values Im({zip code}), Im({city}), etc. from data. As explained in Section 6.2, we had asked the subjects to assess the sensitivity of sharing their locations at different levels of precision. This approach also allows us put the identifiability cost I(A) and sensitivity S(A) into the same units.\nSimilarly, we assessed the amount of improvement in search performance that would be required in order to share attributes of a given sensitivity. We associate a number of bits with each level of improvement: A speedup by a factor of x would require log2 x bits (i.e., doubling the search performance would require 1 bit, etc.). We then concatenat the mappings from location granularity to sensitivity, and from sensitivity to utility (bits), and compute the median number of bits required for sharing each location granularity. Using this approach, we can put sensitivity S(A) and utility U(A) into the same units. Thereby, we effectively use sensitivity as a common currency between utility and cost. This procedure is (up to discretization) invariant of the particular scale (such as 1 to 5) used to assess sensitivity.\nWe perform a linear regression analysis to align the cost curve estimated from data with the curve obtained from the survey. The least-squares alignment is presented in Figure 8(b), and obtained for a value of \u03bb \u2248 5.12. Note that this value of \u03bbmaps exactly into the sweet spot 1 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 10 of the tradeoff curve of Figure 8(b)."}, {"heading": "7.3 Optimizing the Utility-Privacy Tradeoff", "text": "Based on the calibration described above, our goal is to find a set of attributes A maximizing the calibrated objective F\u03bb(A) according to (3.1).\nFirst, we use the greedy algorithm to obtain an ordering of the attributes, similarly to the cases where we optimize utility and cost separately. Figure 10 presents the results of this experiment.\nInstead of using the greedy algorithm, we can use LLS to approximately solve this optimization problem. The algorithm terminates after two upward and downward passes, with solution AFRQ, ATLV, AWDY, AQRY, ACLK, DAGE and TSPT. Note that the first element selected during the initial greedy upward pass is DOCC (the occupation), but it is discarded in the first downward pass again, since its individual sensitivity is quite high (c.f., Figure 2), and the additional information provided over the remaining 6 attributes is not high enough to warrant its presence in the optimal solution.\nWe also compared the optimized solutionAopt to the results of various heuristic procedures. For example, we compared it to the candidate solutionAdem where we select all demographic attributes (all attributes starting with D); Atopic where we select all topic interest attributes (starting with T); Asearch including all search statistics (ATLV, AWDY, AWHR, AFRQ); AIP , the entire IP address orAIP2, the first two bytes of the IP address. Figure 11 presents the results of this comparison. The optimized solutionAopt obtains the best score of 0.83, achieving a click entropy reduction of\u2248 1.4.\nThe search statistics Asearch performs second best, with a score of 0.57, but achieving a drastically lower utility of only 0.8. Demographic information Adem achieves higher utility of 0.95, but much higher cost, and hence an even lower total score of 0.3. Perhaps surprisingly, the collection of topic interests, Atopic results in negative total score of -1.73, achieving less utility than the optimized solution. We believe that the reason for this is that knowledge of the exact topic interest profile frequently suffices to uniquely identify a searcher. As expected, the IP address (even the first 2 bytes) are quite identifying in this data set, and hence has very high cost. This experiment shows that the optimization problem is non-trivial, and the optimized solution outperforms heuristic choices.\nWe also measured the running time of the algorithms, on a standard desktop PC (3 GHz) using a C#-implementation. Figure 12 presents the running times for the greedy and local search algorithms, both with and without the lazy evaluation trick. We note that the local search algorithm is not much slower than the greedy algorithm; frequently, only a single upward and downward pass are necessary, and only a small number of attributes have to be considered for elimination in the downward pass. We also note that using lazy evaluations drastically speeds up the running time\u2014 from 522.1 minutes without to 225.7 with lazy evaluations. To obtain a tradeoff curve like the one in Figure 8(b), the algorithm has to be run for each value of \u03bb; hence any improvement is important. We also estimated the running time required for exhaustive search. Here, we considered only sets of size at most 8 (assuming that the optimal solution is of similar size as the approximate solution).

While they consider approaches to quantifying privacy cost, they do not present efficient algorithms with guarantees for trading off utility and privacy as we do in this paper.\nAnother important class of cryptographic approaches to privacy consider protection of privacy in the context of interactive analyses. In these approaches, a database contains an arbitrary amount of private information, which is securely guarded. Access to this database is enabled via a limited form of queries, which guarantee privacy. One prominent example of such techniques is the notion of differential privacy (Dwork, 2006). This notion quantifies the risk for each user incurred by participating in a database. Intuitively, queries are only allowed, if the corresponding results do not significantly depend on the presence or absence of individuals in the database. Blum et al. (2008) show how differential privacy (and a stronger variant called distributional privacy) can be achieved even in a non-interactive setting. However their approach is efficient only for a limited class of queries that, e.g., does not allow to estimate click probabilities as considered in this paper. Although these approaches provide crisp mathematical definitions of privacy, they are not designed with a specific notion of utility in mind. Rather, a specific privacy requirement is formulated, and analyses show the limits of data usage that are consistent with the requirement. We believe that the utility-theoretic approach to privacy is complementary to the cryptographic definitions of privacy. While our approach can be used to develop a privacy-aware design, existing techniques such as differential privacy can, e.g., be used to guard access to the private information. The utilitytheoretic analyses also allow for new scenarios, such as identifying the value of specific private data for a specific context, and requesting this data in real time, for short-term usage. Such applications bypass the assumption of long-term, large-scale storage of private data that are explored within cryptographical analyses of privacy."}, {"heading": "8.5 Utility-Privacy Tradeoff", "text": "Algorithmic approaches for optimizing the tradeoff have been considered in the area of privacypreserving data publishing, which focuses on anonymization techniques. In these settings, a constraint on privacy is typically specified (in terms of k-anonymity, Sweeney, 2002, or l-diversity, Machanavajjhala et al., 2006) and then a recoding scheme is applied which maximizes a specified quality metric. Recent work involves the development of a greedy algorithm (LeFevre et al.,\n2006) and branch and bound search (Hore & R. Jammalamadaka, 2007). To our knowledge, these algorithms have no performance and approximation guarantees.\nOur approach is different, in that we explicitly quantify both utility and cost in the same units, and optimize a single scalar value of information problem. Moreover, we use an application specific utility function, rather than a distortion metric. Furthermore, our algorithm is guaranteed to provide near-optimal solutions to the optimization problem."}, {"heading": "9.

(2005) and Xu et al. (2007). With such an approach, private information is used to re-rank search results locally, and never transmitted across the network, avoiding the risk of misuse or unintended release. However, the private information does not (easily) migrate with the user across multiple machines, and privacy concerns are effectively replaced by security concerns, requiring that the local machine not be compromised. The proposed methodology could be useful in mitigating security concerns; client services might be optimized to acquire and store only the most relevant information."}, {"heading": "9.3 Server-side Private Information", "text": "On the server side, designs for privacy, especially with regard to the storage and usage of behavioral data, is of critical importance to services and their users.\nThe methods described can be used to balance user sensitivity and service utility, and to address such questions as which data should be logged, and which anonymization techniques should be used (c.f., Adar, 2007 for a discussion of the difficulties and possible options in anonymizing web search logs). Furthermore, specific personal (e.g., demographic) information could be voluntarily made available by the web searcher to the web service in form of, e.g., a user profile. In both settings, the proposed methodology could potentially be used to trade off privacy and utility."}, {"heading": "9.4 Channel-side Private Information", "text": "We also foresee applications where private data is transmitted on a per-request basis.

Here, the utility-privacy tradeoff would determine which information is being logged, collected in local profiles, or which private bits are made part of the protocol used to transmit service requests. This approach has the advantage that always the same private bits are used, and inference attacks combining private information from different requests are not possible."}, {"heading": "9.5.2 DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION", "text": "As we mentioned earlier, systems can be endowed with the ability to make dynamic recommendations to users or take actions in accordance with user preferences in the course of online activities. Dynamic variants of the methods we have presented can be used to identify the best subset of private information for sharing so as to optimize utility for a user. With web search, depending on the query, different kinds of personal information may be most helpful for disambiguation. The utility-theoretic approach to privacy could be used to determine needs in real time. Challenges with implementing such a real-time, interactive approach, include grappling with the possibility that inference attacks can combine the bits from different requests. Anonymization procedures can be designed to resist such challenges. Another challenge is computational efficiency, as solving an optimization problem may be required for each service request. The main advantage of employing a dynamic approach is that the average number of private bits (and hence the identifiability cost) per request could be lower than in the a priori privacy-aware design. The a priori design requires a collection of private bits which help disambiguating all queries versus context-specific situations. This interactive approach would additionally allow users to share private information on a per-request basis. Such interactive decisions also require considerations of how preferences about tradeoffs and private information are acquired from users\u2014and will rely on the design of user interaction models and interfaces to provide users with awareness about opportunities for enhancing the value of services and controls for guiding the revelation of private information. Recent developments in adaptive submodularity may provide the methods necessary to achieve such dynamic, adaptive optimization of tradeoffs (Golovin & Krause, 2010)."}, {"heading": "9.6 Other Applications", "text": "The increasing cost property which characterizes the identifiability cost potentially arises in other contexts as well. For example, for many algorithms, the computational cost scales superlinearly in the number of dimensions / attributes considered. In such cases, the problem of trading off information (such as the click entropy reduction) and computation cost have the same combinatorial structure as the utility-privacy tradeoff addressed in this paper. Some of the algorithmic/computational considerations presented in this paper, such as the lazy local search algorithm, or sample complexity analyses, apply to such contexts as well."}, {"heading": "10. Conclusions", "text": "We presented an approach for explicitly optimizing the utility-privacy tradeoff in personalized services such as web search. We showed that utility functions like click entropy reduction satisfy submodularity, an intuitive diminishing-returns property. In contrast, privacy concerns show supermodularity; the more private information we accrue, the faster sensitivity and the risk of identifiability grow. Based on the submodular utility and supermodular cost functions, we demonstrated how we can efficiently find a provably near-optimal utility-privacy tradeoff. We evaluated our methodology on real-world web search data. We demonstrated how the quantitative tradeoff can be calibrated according to personal preferences, obtained from user study with over 1,400 participants. Overall, we found that significant personalization can be achieved using only a small amount of information about users. We believe that the principles and methods employed in the utility-theoretic analysis of tradeoffs for web search have applicability to the personalization of a broad variety of online services. The results underscore the value of taking a decision-theoretic approach to privacy, where we seek to jointly understand the utility of personalization that can be achieved via access to information about users, and the preferences of users about the costs and benefits of selectively sharing their personal data with online services."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Andreas Krause was an intern at Microsoft Research while this work was performed.

Proofs", "text": "Proof of Theorem 2.1. Let n = |cV |. We prove the result for a choice of I(A), where I(A) = 0 if |A| < n/2 and I(A) = 2\u2217M\u2217(|A|\u2212n/2) otherwise, whereM = U(V) is the maximum achievable utility. In this case, F1(A) = U(A) \u2265 0 if |A| \u2264 n/2, and F1(A) < 0 if |A| > n/2. Hence,\nargmax A F1(A) = argmax A:|A|\u2264n/2 U(A).\nHowever, Krause and Guestrin (2005) show that if there were a polynomial time algorithm which is guaranteed to find a set A\u2032 such that U(A\u2032) \u2265 (1\u2212 1/e) maxA:|A|\u2264n/2 U(A), then P = NP .\nProof of Theorem 3.2. Let Y = (A,B) (i.e., V is partitioned into A and B). Then, Im(A) = \u2211 a P (a) max b P (b | a) = \u2211 a P (a) max b P (b)\n= max b P (b) = max b \u220f i P (bi) = \u220f i max bi P (bi) = \u220f i wi\nwhere wi = maxbi P (bi). Now, Im(A) is nondecreasing in A. Furthermore, for subsets A,A\u2032 \u2286 V and B = A \u222a A\u2032, it holds that Im(B) = \u03b1Im(A) for \u03b1 \u2265 1. Furthermore, if V \u2208 V \\ B and w = maxv P (V = v), then Im(B \u222a {V }) = w\u22121Im(B) and Im(A \u222a {V }) = w\u22121Im(A). Hence,\nIm(B \u222a {V })\u2212 Im(B) Im(A \u222a {V })\u2212 Im(A) = \u03b1(w\u22121 \u2212 1) w\u22121 \u2212 1 = \u03b1 \u2265 1,\nwhich proves the supermodularity of Im(A).\nProof of Theorem 4.4. Additive error carries through Lemma 3.3. and subsequently through the proof of Theorem 3.4. of Feige et al. (2007). In order to guarantee the confidence 1 \u2212 \u03b4, we apply the union bound. The sample complexity then follows from Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3.\nProof of Theorem 4.5. Let C be an optimal solution.

For example, a user\u2019s demographics, location, and past search and browsing may be useful in enhancing the results offered in response to web search queries. However, reasonable concerns about privacy by both users, providers, and government agencies acting on behalf of citizens, may limit access by services to such information. We introduce and explore an economics of privacy in personalization, where people can opt to share personal information, in a standing or on-demand manner, in return for expected enhancements in the quality of an online service. We focus on the example of web search and formulate realistic objective functions for search efficacy and privacy. We demonstrate how we can find a provably near-optimal optimization of the utility-privacy tradeoff in an efficient manner. We evaluate our methodology on data drawn from a log of the search activity of volunteer participants. We separately assess users preferences about privacy and utility via a large-scale survey, aimed at eliciting preferences about peoples willingness to trade the sharing of personal data in returns for gains in search efficiency. We show that a significant level of personalization can be achieved using a relatively small amount of information about users.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
