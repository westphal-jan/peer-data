For more on important early works, see the references of [5].\nWe are interested in the case of a uniform binary tree such that each leaf is bi-valued. In this special case, a mini-max tree makes a binary AND-OR tree; And, the alpha-beta pruning is described in a simple way. Given an AND-node (an OR-node, respectively) v, if we know a child of v has the value 0 (1) then we know that v has the same value, without probing the other child. Here, a cut-off (or, a skip) happens at the other child.\nAnd, we are interested in the case where an associated probability distribution d on the truth assignments to the leaves is an independent distribution (ID) but d is not necessarily an independent identical distribution (IID). Here, an IID denotes an ID such that all the leaves have the same probability of having the value 0.\nYao\u2019s principle [9], a variation of von-Neumann\u2019s minimax theorem, is useful for analyzing equilibriums of AND-OR trees. Saks and Wigderson [6] establish basic results on the equilibriums. Liu and Tanaka [3] have extended the works of Yao and Saks-Wigderson. And, they study the eigen-distribution, the distribution achieving the equilibrium. In the course of their study, Liu and Tanaka showed the following.\nTheorem 1. (Liu and Tanaka, Theorem 4 of [3]) If d is an eigen-distribution with respect to IDs then d is an IID.\nThey write \u201cit is not hard\u201d to show the theorem, and omit the proof. In this paper, we show a stronger form of the above theorem. Throughout the paper, a probability of a given node denotes the probability that the node has the value 0.\nMain Theorem (Theorem 6) Suppose that r is a real number such that 0 < r < 1. Suppose that we restrict ourselves to distributions such that the probability of the root is r. Under this constraint, Theorem 1 still holds.\nOur proof of Theorem 6 employs clever tricks of induction. In particular, we show the following two lemmas by induction.\nLemma 2 Suppose that an OR-AND tree is given. Given an x (0 < x < 1), we consider an IID such that each leaf has probability x. Then, the following quantity is a decreasing function of x. Here, the numerator (the denominator) denotes the expected value of the cost (the probability of the root, respectively).\ncost(x)\nprob(x)\nLemma 3 Under the same assumption of Lemma 2, the following quantity is a decreasing function of x. Here, the primes denote differentiation.\ncost\u2032(x) prob\u2032(x)\nLemmas 2 and 3 describe fundamental relationships between the cost and the probability in an IID on an OR-AND tree. In section 3, we prove these lemmas. In section 4, we prove Theorem 6 by using Lemmas 2 and 3. We show Theorem 1 as a corollary to Theorem 6 in section 5. The main motive for Theorem 1 is the following (Theorem 9 of [3]) : The equilibrium among all IDs is strictly smaller than the equilibrium among all ditributions. In section 6, we observe that the above result still holds under the constraint on the probability of the root. In section 7, we discuss whether Theorem 1 is really \u201cnot hard\u201d.

A leaf means a terminal node. Throughout the paper, unless specified, a tree is assumed to be a uniform binary tree. In other words, every internal node has just 2 child nodes, and all the leaves have the same distance from the root.\nFigure 1 shows an example of an AND-OR tree of height 2. If we exchange the roles of AND-gates (\u2227) and those of OR-gates (\u2228), the resulting tree is an OR-AND tree of height 2.\nA truth assignment for a tree is a mapping from the set of all leaves to {0, 1}. Here, 0 stands for FALSE and 1 stands for TRUE. An example of a truth assignment for the tree in Figure 1 is as follows: f(x00) = f(x01) = f(x01) = 1 and f(x11) = 0. Throughout the paper, a distribution denotes a probability distribution on the truth assignments for a given tree.\nWe consider algorithms finding the value of the root. An algorithm makes some queries to leaves. We concentrate on deterministic algorithms: An algorithm does not perform coin tossing. An algorithm may be directional or un-directional. An algorithm is said to be directional if for some linear arrangement of the leaves it never selects for examination a node situated to the left of a previously examined node [4, p.121]. Otherwise, the algorithm is un-directional.\nAn alpha-beta pruning algorithm for an AND-OR tree (or an OR-AND tree) is defined in Introduction. Throughout the paper, a deterministic algorithm is assumed to be a deterministic alpha-beta pruning algorithm on a given tree.\nGiven an algorithm and a truth assignment, their cost denotes the number of leaves probed during the computation. Given an algorithm AD and a distribution d, their cost denotes the expected value of the cost. We denote the cost by C(AD, d).\nGiven a classB of distributions, a distribution d0 \u2208 B is an eigen-distribution with respect to B if d is a maximizer of the minimum cost [3]. To be more precise, if the following holds.\nmin AD C(AD, d0) = max d min AD C(AD, d) (1)\nHere, AD runs over all deterministic algorithms. And, d runs over all elements of B.\nThroughout the paper, unless specified, in expressions such as minAD and maxAD , AD runs over all deterministic algorithm on a given tree.\nLet h be a positive integer, and T a uniform binary AND-OR tree of height h. Given a real number x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 1), we consider an ID on T such that each leaf has probability (having the value 0) x. Then, p\u2227,h(x) (c\u2227,h(x), respectively) denotes the probability (the expected cost, respectively) of the root.\nGiven a uniform binary OR-AND tree of height h, we define p\u2228,h(x) and c\u2228,h(x) in the same way."}, {"heading": "3 Relationships between Costs and Probabili-", "text": "ties\nLemma 2. Suppose that h is a positive integer. Then, the following quantity is a decreasing function of x (0 < x < 1).\nc\u2228,h(x) p\u2228,h(x) (2)\nProof. The cases of height = 1, 2 are easy. As a preliminary observation for an induction step, consider an OR-AND tree of height 2. And, consider an IID in which each leaf has probability x, where 0 < x < 1. Then, the cost and probability are given as follows.\nc\u2228,2(x) = (2\u2212 x)(\u2212x2 + 2x+ 1) (3) p\u2228,2(x) = x 2(x\u2212 2)2 (4)\nNow, we are going into an induction step. Let h be a positive integer. We consider an OR-AND tree of height h+2. By (3) and (4), we have the followings.\nc\u2228,h+2(x) = (2\u2212 p\u2228,h(x))(\u2212p\u2228,h(x)2 + 2p\u2228,h(x) + 1)\u00d7 c\u2228,h(x) (5) p\u2228,h+2(x) = p\u2228,h(x) 2(p\u2228,h(x)\u2212 2)2 (6)\nTherefore, the following holds.\nc\u2228,h+2(x) p\u2228,h+2(x) = ( 1 + 1 p\u2228,h(x)(2 \u2212 p\u2228,h(x)) ) \u00d7 c\u2228,h(x) p\u2228,h(x)\n(7)\nBoth of the two factors in the right-hand side are positive. When x varies from 0 to 1, p\u2228,h(x) is an increasing function that varies from 0 to 1. Thus, the first factor is decreasing. And, the second factor is decreasing, by the induction hypothesis. Hence, the left-hand side of (7) is decreasing.\nConsider the dual of the tree. Then the numerators of both sides of (8) are the same. And, the same thing holds for the denominators.

As an induction step, we consider an OR-AND tree of height h+ 1. The goal is to show that the following quantity is decreasing.\nc\u2032 \u2228,h+1(x) p\u2032 \u2228,h+1(x)\n(11)\nLet z := p\u2227,h(x). Thus, z is the probability of the node just under the root.

Now, define a function c(z) (0 < z < 1) as follows.\nc(z) := c\u2227,h(p \u22121 \u2227,h(z)) (13)\nThen, the followings hold.\nc\u2228,h+1(p \u22121 \u2227,h(z)) = c(z)(1 + z) (14) p\u2228,h+1(p \u22121 \u2227,h(z)) = z 2 (15)\nNow, we look at the following quantity.\nd\ndz\n( dc\u2228,h+1\ndz dp\u2228,h+1\ndz\n)\n= [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ]\n(dp\u2228,h+1 dz\n)2 (16)\nBy (14) and (15), the numerator [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] of the right-hand side equals to the following.\n{c(z)(1 + z)}\u2032\u2032(z2)\u2032 \u2212 {c(z)(1 + z)}\u2032(z2)\u2032\u2032\n=2{c\u2032\u2032(z)(1 + z)z + c\u2032(z)(z \u2212 1)\u2212 c(z)} (17)\nIn the remainder of the proof, we are going to show that the right-hand side of (17) is negative. By the induction hypothesis and (9), the following holds.\nd\ndx\n( c\u2032 \u2227,h(x)\n(1\u2212 p\u2227,h(x))\u2032 ) > 0 (18)\nRecall that dz/dx = p\u2032 \u2227,h(x) > 0 for all x such that 0 < x < 1. Therefore, derivative of a given function by x is positive if and only if derivative of it by z is positive. Hence, by (18), the followings hold.\nd dz (\u2212c\u2032(z)) = d dz\n(\nc\u2032(z)\nd(1\u2212 z) dz\n)\n= d\ndz\n( c\u2032 \u2227,h(x)\n(1 \u2212 p\u2227,h(x))\u2032 ) > 0 (19)\nTherefore, we get the following.\nc\u2032\u2032(z) < 0 (20)\nOn the other hand, by Lemma 2 and (8), the following holds.\nd\ndx\n( c\u2227,h(x) 1\u2212 p\u2227,h(x) ) > 0 (21)\nTherefore, we get the following.\nd\ndz\n( c(z) 1\u2212 z ) > 0 (22)\nThus, it holds that c\u2032(z)(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 c(z)(1 \u2212 z)\u2032 > 0. Therefore, we get the following.\nc\u2032(z)(z \u2212 1)\u2212 c(z) < 0 (23)\nBy (17), (20) and (23), it holds that (16) is negative. Hence, the right-hand sid of (12) is a decreasing function of z (0 < z < 1). Therefore, (11) is a decreasing function of x (0 < x < 1).\nAs examples, we show graphs of c\u2228,4(x)/p\u2228,4(x) and c \u2032 \u2228,4(x)/p \u2032 \u2228,4(x) (0.1 < x < 0.9)."}, {"heading": "4 Main Theorem", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Constraint Extremum Problem", "text": "We consider the following constraint extremum problem.

Hence, when we replace the objective function (24) by min{f(z, w), f(w, z)}, the resulting constraint extremum problem is equivalent to Constraint Extremum Problem 1.\nAnd, it is easy to see the following.\nmin{f(z, w), f(w, z)} = min AD C(AD, d) (27)\nHere, the meaning of the right-hand side is as follows. We consider an ANDOR tree of height h+1 \u2265 2. And, d is the ID defined as follows. The restrictions of d to the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree are IIDs; The left child of the root has the probability z and the other child of the root has the probability w.\nLemma 4.

We define f1(z) (1 \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 r \u2264 z \u2264 r) as to be f(z, \u03c9(z)), where \u03c9(z) := 1\u2212 (1\u2212 r)/(1\u2212 z). Thus, we have the following.\nf1(z) = c(z) + (1\u2212 z)c(\u03c9(z)) (28) Here, we have \u03c9\u2032(z) = \u2212(1\u2212 r)/(1\u2212 z)2.

We consider a variable transformation t = p\u22121\n\u2228,h(u) (0 \u2264 u \u2264 r). Then dt/du = 1/(du/dt) = 1/(p\u2032\u2228,h(t)) > 0.

We are going to show the following, by induction on k \u2265 1.\n\u03b1 < \u2200x < 1 c\u2228,2k+1(x) > 2k+1 (40) The case of k = 1 is shown as follows.\nc\u2227,2(x) = (1 + x)(2 \u2212 x2) (41) p\u2227,2(x) = \u2212x2(x2 \u2212 2) (42)\nc\u2228,3(x)\u2212 22 = c\u2227,2(x)(1 + p\u2227,2(x)) \u2212 22\n= (x\u2212 1)f(x) (43)\nIn the interval \u03b1 < x < 1, it holds that c\u2227,3(x) \u2212 22 > 0. Thus, (40) holds in the case of k = 1.\nNext, we look at induction step of (40). The followings hold.\nc\u2228,2k+3(x) = c\u2227,2k+2(x)(1 + p\u2227,2k+2(x))\n= c\u2227,2(p\u2227,2k(x))c\u2227,2k(x)(1 + p\u2227,2(p\u2227,2k(x)))\n= c\u2227,2k(x)(1 + p\u2227,2k(x)) \u00d7 c\u2227,2(p\u2227,2k(x))(1 + p\u2227,2(p\u2227,2k(x)))\n1 + p\u2227,2k(x)\n= c\u2228,2k+1(x)\u00d7 c\u2227,2(p\u2227,2k(x))(1 + p\u2227,2(p\u2227,2k(x)))\n1 + p\u2227,2k(x) (44)\nHere, in the interval 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1, the following is easily verified.\nc\u2227,2(t)(1 + p\u2227,2(t))\n1 + t = t2(1 \u2212 t2)(3\u2212 t2) + 2 (45)\nBy (44), (45) and by the induction hypothesis c\u2228,2k+1(x) > 2 k+1 (\u03b1 < x <\n1), it holds that c\u2228,2k+3(x) > 2 k+2 (\u03b1 < x < 1).\nThus, we have shown (40) for all positive integer k. Therefore, it holds that c\u2227,2k+1(x) > 2\nk+1 in the interval 0 < x < 1\u2212 \u03b1. Therefore, by Proposition 5, the probability of the root in d is neither 0 nor\n1."}, {"heading": "6 Comparison with Correlated Distributions", "text": "In [3], the main motive for Theorem 1 is the following.\nTheorem 7. (Liu and Tanaka. A corollary to Theorem 9 of [3]) Suppose that T is an AND-OR tree whose height is positive and even. The equilibrium among all IDs is strictly smaller than the equilibrium among all ditributions. To be more precise, the following holds.\nmax d:ID min AD C(AD, d) < max d min AD C(AD, d) (46)\nIn the left-hand side, d runs over all IDs. In the right-hand side, d runs over all distributions.\nThe above result extends to the case where the probability of the root is fixed. To be more precise, the following holds.\nTheorem 8. Suppose that T is an AND-OR tree whose height is greater than or equal to 2. Let r be a real number such that 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1. Now, we restrict ourselves to the distribution such that the probability of the root is r. Then, the equilibrium among all IDs is strictly smaller than the equilibrium among all ditributions.\nmax d:ID,r min AD C(AD, d) < max d:r min AD C(AD, d) (47)\nIn the left-hand side, d runs over all IDs such that the probability of the root is r. In the right-hand side, d runs over all distributions such that the probability of the root is r.\nThe proof of the theorem is given by using i-sets. Saks and Wigderson [6] introduced the concept of a reluctant input. A truth assignment is said to be reluctant if it satisfies the following two requirements. (1) If an AND gate has the value 0, then exactly one child has the value 0; (2) If an OR gate has the value 1, then exactly one child has the value 1.\nLiu and Tanaka [3] introduced the concepts of 0-set and 1-set. 0-set (1-set, respectively) is the set of all reluctant truth assignments such that the root has the value 0 (1, respectively). In [3], it is shown that the right-hand side of (46) is achieved only by the uniform distribution on the 1-set.\nProof. (of Theorem 8. Sketch) Suppose that d0 is an ID with the following two properties: The probability of the root is r; And, minAD C(AD, d0) equals to the left-hand side of (47). And, let A0 be a deterministic algorithm such that C(A0, d0) = minAD C(AD, d0).\nFor each i \u2208 {0, 1}, let diunif. be the uniform distribution on the i-set. And, let dmix be the mixed strategy of d 0 unif. and d 1 unif. with weights r : 1\u2212 r.\nCase 1: r = 0 or 1. By Proposition 5, it holds that C(A0, d0) < C(A0, dmix). Case 2: Otherwise. Then 0 < r < 1. By Theorem 6, d0 is the IID with root having probability r. Then, it is not hard to see that C(A0, d0) < C(A0, dmix). Thus, we have shown the theorem.\nFor more precise on the cost of uniform distributions on the i-sets, see [7, Lemma 3]."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusive Remarks", "text": "Is Theorem 1 is not hard to show?

We investigate the case of the height = h + 1. By the induction hypothesis, the restriction of a given ID to the left sub-tree is obviously an IID. And, the same thing holds for the right sub-tree. Hence, by the method of Lagrange multipliers, the statement of the theorem for height = h+ 1 is immediately shown.\u201d"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors would like to thank Kousuke Ogawa and Masahiro Kumabe for helpful discussions."}], "references": [{"title": "On the branching factor of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm", "author": ["G.M.
