Introduction", "text": "A question whether Dung\u2019s (1995) abstract theory can be used as a general framework for nonmonotonic reasoning has drawn a particular amount of attention among researchers in artificial intelligence. More precisely, the question is: can existing or new approaches to reasoning be seen as instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory? This is certainly a very general question. Furthermore, different approaches suppose that the available knowledge is represented in different form. This paper studies the problem setting when one is given a finite inconsistent set of classical propositional logic formulae, which we refer to as a knowledge base. There are a number of approaches for dealing with inconsistent information: a notable example are paraconsistent logics (Priest, 2002) where one is able to draw some (but not all) conclusions from an inconsistent set of formulae. Indeed, each paraconsistent logic allows for a subset of the inferences that could be obtained using classical logic with the same knowledge. Other examples of dealing with inconsistent knowledge include belief revision (Gardenfors, 1988), belief merging (Konieczny & Pe\u0301rez, 2011) or voting (Arrow, Sen, & Suzumura, 2002). To be completely precise, note that there are approaches where one is given a multiset instead of a set, for example where several voters can express their knowledge or preferences and the number of agents stating / voting for a proposition is important. However, in this paper, we suppose that the information is represented in form of a set.\nc\u00a92013 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nGenerally speaking, we call an operator a function which provides a way to go from an inconsistent knowledge base to a set of subsets of that knowledge base. Examples of operators are: a function returning maximal for set inclusion consistent subsets of a knowledge base, called maxiconsistent operator, a function returning maximal for cardinality consistent subsets of a knowledge base, called maxi-card operator, a function returning all consistent subsets of a knowledge base...\nTo understand how and to which extent Dung\u2019s theory can be used as a general framework for reasoning, it is essential to study the link between the result obtained by applying an operator to a knowledge base \u03a3 and the extensions of the argumentation framework F = (Arg(\u03a3),R), where for a set S \u2286 \u03a3, we denote by Arg(S) the set of all arguments that can be built from S, and by R the relation used for identifying attacks between arguments. There are papers (Cayrol, 1995; Caminada & Amgoud, 2007; Amgoud & Besnard, 2009, 2010; Amgoud & Vesic, 2010; Gorogiannis & Hunter, 2011) studying the notions which are somehow related to a link between a knowledge base and the corresponding argumentation framework. However, since the work of Dung (1995), there are almost no papers studying the link between an operator and an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory. Cayrol (1995) showed that the instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory using stable semantics and direct undercut as attack relation, corresponds to maxi-consistent operator. In argumentation community, this one-to-one correspondence is sometimes identified as a main objection against pure logic-based argumentation, because the additional value of constructing the argumentation framework is then said to be questionable (since computing the extensions does not do more than applying maxiconsistent operator). However, a recent work by Vesic and van der Torre (2012) shows that there exists a large class of logic-based instantiations of Dung\u2019s abstract theory having two interesting features: (i) it returns extensions that do not correspond to maximal consistent subsets of the initial knowledge base, and (ii) its result satisfies basic argumentation postulates (Caminada & Amgoud, 2007), e.g. consistency, closure... That paper shows that the space of logic-based instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory is much larger than it was believed.\nThe previous result makes the question \u201cwhat is the class of operators that can be viewed as instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory?\u201d even more relevant as a research topic. We now aim only at giving a broad overview of this class. First note that, interestingly, there is a rather big class of instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory returning inconsistent results, as showed by Caminada and Amgoud (2007). However, one would normally prefer to avoid this type of behaviour, and to study the class of instantiations returning consistent results.1 Thus, our long-term goal is to identify the whole class of instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory that yield a consistent result. However, that is certainly a hard task. We start by noticing that, given a set \u03a3, the most common and a well-known way to deal with inconsistent information is to use the maxi-consistent operator, i.e. to select maximal consistent subsets of \u03a3. Also, we conjecture that one of the \u201cbiggest\u201d2 sub-classes of the class of instantiations returning a consistent result is the class of instantiations corresponding to maxi-consistent operator. That is why our first goal, and the main goal of this paper, is to study this class. (Note that a more general approach would consider the set of maxi-consistent subsets of \u03a3 and a selection function f among the maxi-consistent subsets. Thus, only some maxi-consistent sets would be used for reasoning. However, the present paper studies the case when all the maxi-consistent subsets of \u03a3 are taken into account since this already captures a significant number of systems.)\n1. Note that while there is no consensus regarding some of the postulates (e.g. indirect consistency), some postulates (e.g. direct consistency) enjoy much wider acceptance. 2. informally, but in the sense: in number of known instantiations\nMore particularly, the paper aims to answering the following questions: What are the properties of attack relations and semantics used in instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory that correspond to maxiconsistent operators? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions so that an attack relation belongs to this class (under a given semantics)? What properties do they satisfy: must (not) they be conflict-dependent, valid, symmetric, ... ? Can we identify sub-classes of attack relations belonging / not belonging to this class? Can we find the lower and / or the upper bound (in terms of set inclusion) of this class of attack relations? Which existing (in the literature) attack relations belong to this class under which semantics? Are there new attack relations belonging to this class?\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the main notions of argumentation theory we use in the rest of the paper. Section 3 formally defines the class of instantiations corresponding to maxi-consistent operator. Section 4 shows what properties are satisfied by attack relations belonging to this class. Section 5 identifies several classes of attack relations (not-)corresponding to maxi-consistent operator. Section 6 shows for all (to the best of our knowledge) existing attack relations from literature whether or not they belong to this class, and also defines a new attack relation which is a member of this class. The last section concludes and discusses related work."}, {"heading": "2. Basics of Argumentation", "text": "As already mentioned, this paper supposes that one is given a set of classical propositional logic formulae \u03a3. We use the well-known (e.g. Besnard & Hunter, 2001; Amgoud & Cayrol, 2002; Gorogiannis & Hunter, 2011) logic-based approach for instantiating Dung\u2019s theory. L denotes the set of well-formed formulae, ` stands for classical entailment, and \u2261 for logical equivalence. We use the notation MC(\u03a3) for the set of all maximal consistent subsets of \u03a3.\nA logical argument is defined as a pair (support, conclusion).\nDefinition 1 (Argument). An argument is a pair (\u03a6, \u03b1) such that \u03a6 \u2286 \u03a3 is a minimal (for set inclusion) consistent set of formulae such that \u03a6 ` \u03b1.\nFor an argument a = (\u03a6, \u03b1), we use the function Supp(a) = \u03a6 to denote its support and Conc(a) = \u03b1 to denote its conclusion.\nExample 1. Let \u03a3 = {\u03d5,\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8, \u03c9}. a = ({\u03d5,\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8}, \u03c8), b = ({\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8},\u00ac\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) and c = ({\u03d5,\u03c8}, \u03d5 \u2194 \u03c8) are some of the arguments that can be constructed from \u03a3. For example, Supp(a) = {\u03d5,\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8} and Conc(a) = \u03c8.\nFor a given set of formulae S, we denote by Arg(S) the set of arguments constructed from S. Formally, Arg(S) = {a | a is an argument and Supp(a) \u2286 S}. Let Arg(L) denote the set of all arguments that can be constructed from the language of propositional logic. For a given set of arguments E , we denote Base(E) = \u22c3 a\u2208E Supp(a). We suppose that function Arg is defined on L and that function Base is defined on Arg(L); by slightly abusing the notation, we sometimes write Arg (respectively Base) for the restriction of these functions on any set of formulae (respectively arguments).\nDefinition 2 (Argumentation system). An argumentation system (AS) is a pair (A,R) where A \u2286 Arg(L) is a set of arguments and R \u2286 A\u00d7A a binary relation. For each pair (a, b) \u2208 R, we say that a attacks b. We also sometimes use notation aRb instead of (a, b) \u2208 R.\nIn order to simplify notation, we do not explicitly mention an argumentation system when it is clear from the context which argumentation system we refer to. Since arguments are built from formulae, we suppose that an attack relation is defined by specifying a condition such that for every two arguments a and b, we have that a attacks b if and only if the condition from the definition of attack relation is satisfied. For example, such a condition can be that the conclusion of a is logically equivalent to the negation of the conclusion of b. We suppose that all attack relations are defined on the set Arg(L) \u00d7 Arg(L), and that for every set A \u2286 Arg(L), we use the restriction of the attack relation on the setA\u00d7A. That is why, in order to simplify notation, we simply writeR for an attack relation defined on the set Arg(L) \u00d7 Arg(L) as well as for the restriction of that attack relation on every set A\u00d7A, with A \u2286 Arg(L).\nIn order to determine mutually acceptable sets of arguments, different semantics have been introduced in argumentation. We first introduce the basic notions of conflict-freeness and defence.\nDefinition 3 (Conflict-free, defence). Let F = (A,R) be an AS, E \u2286 A and a \u2208 A.\n\u2022 E is conflict-free if and only if there exist no arguments a, b \u2208 E such that aR b\n\u2022 E defends a if and only if for every b \u2208 A we have that if b R a then there exists c \u2208 E such that cR b.\nLet us now define the most commonly used semantics.\nDefinition 4 (Acceptability semantics). Let F = (A,R) be an AS and B \u2286 A. We say that a set B is admissible if and only if it is conflict-free and defends all its elements.\n\u2022 B is a complete extension if and only if B defends all its arguments and contains all the arguments it defends.\n\u2022 B is a preferred extension if and only if it is a maximal (with respect to set inclusion) admissible set.\n\u2022 B is a stable extension if and only if B is conflict-free and for all a \u2208 A\\B, there exists b \u2208 B such that bR a.\n\u2022 B is a semi-stable extension if and only if B is a complete extension and the union of the set B and the set of all arguments attacked by B is maximal (for set inclusion).\n\u2022 B is a grounded extension if and only if B is a minimal (for set inclusion) complete extension.\n\u2022 B is an ideal extension if and only ifB is a maximal (for set inclusion) admissible set contained in every preferred extension.\nFor an argumentation system F = (A,R) we denote by Extx(F); or, by a slight abuse of notation, by Extx(A,R) the set of its extensions with respect to semantics x. We use abbreviations c, p, s, ss, g and i for respectively complete, preferred, stable, semi-stable, grounded and ideal semantics. For example, Extp(F) denotes the set of preferred extensions argumentation system F .\nExample 2. Let F = (A,R) be an argumentation framework with A = {a, b, c, d} and R = {(b, c), (c, b), (b, d), (c, d)}. There are two preferred/stable/semi-stable extensions: {a, b} and {a, c}; three complete extensions: {a}, {a, b} and {a, c}; and one grounded/ideal extension: {a}."}, {"heading": "3. Defining the Problem Setting", "text": "Until now, we specified how to, from a knowledge base \u03a3, construct an argumentation system F = (Arg(\u03a3),R), and then, using a chosen semantics, calculate extensions. Since all the components of the system except a semantics and an attack relation are fixed, then whether an instantiation corresponds to maxi-consistent operator depends exclusively on those two components. The next definition provides a formal definition of what we mean by saying that an instantiation of Dung\u2019s framework \u201ccorresponds\u201d to maxi-consistent operator. The idea is that the function Arg should be a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and the extensions of the corresponding argumentation system.\nDefinition 5 (MC \u2194 Ext). Let x be an argumentation semantics. We say that attack relation R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx) if and only if for every finite set of propositional formulae \u03a3 we have that\nArg is a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Extx(Arg(\u03a3),R)\nThis means that for every set S \u2208 MC(\u03a3), it holds that Arg(S) \u2208 Ext(Arg(\u03a3),R) and for every E \u2208 Ext(Arg(\u03a3),R), there exists S \u2208 MC(\u03a3) such that E = Arg(S). For example, we say that an attack relation R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extc) if and only if for every finite \u03a3, we have that Arg is a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Extc(Arg(\u03a3),R). Sometimes, when it is clear from the context which semantics we refer to or when a semantics is not important, we use the simplified notation (MC\u2194 Ext). We say that an attack relationR falsifies (MC\u2194 Extx) if and only ifR does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx). The following example shows an attack relation that does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Exts).\nExample 3. Consider the attack relation known as defeating rebut, denoted by Rdr and defined as follows: for two arguments a and b, we say that a attacks b and write aRdrb if and only if Conc(a) ` \u00acConc(b). This attack relation falsifies (MC\u2194 Exts). To see why, it is sufficient to find a set of formulae \u03a3 such that Arg is not a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and (Arg(\u03a3),Rdr). To that end, consider \u03a3 = {\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8,\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8} and denote F = (Arg(\u03a3),Rdr). We see that MC(\u03a3) = {S1, S2} with S1 = {\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8} and S2 = {\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8}. Denote E1 = Arg(S1) and E2 = Arg(S2). If Exts(F) 6= {E1, E2} then Rdr does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Exts). Consider argument a = ({\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8}, \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8), and note that a \u2208 E1. Observe that for every argument b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3), we have that bRdra if and only if Conc(b) ` \u00ac(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8). In other words, for every argument b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3), b attacks a if and only if Conc(b) ` \u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8. Recall that from Definition 1 we know that for every argument b, Supp(b) ` Conc(b). Thus, for every argument b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3), if bRdra then Supp(b) ` \u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8. Since \u03a3 = {\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8,\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8} then there is no argument b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) such that Supp(b) ` \u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8. Thus, argument a is not attacked by any argument of E2. This means that E2 is not a stable extension of F . Consequently, Arg is not a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Exts(F). Hence, Rdr falsifies (MC\u2194 Exts)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Complete and Incomplete Systems", "text": "There are two ways to study the link between an instantiated argumentation system F (containing arguments and attacks between them) and the corresponding knowledge base \u03a3 (containing formulae). The first scenario is as follows:\n\u2022 choose an attack relationR and a semantics x\n\u2022 start with a finite knowledge base \u03a3\n\u2022 consider the system F = (Arg(\u03a3),R), containing all the arguments that can be built from \u03a3\n\u2022 compare the result obtained by using an operator on \u03a3 and the one obtained by calculating the extensions of F\nIn this case, we say that the obtained argumentation system is complete. Every complete system has an infinite number of arguments, but for every complete system F , there exists a finite system F \u2032 such that F and F \u2032 are equivalent. How to formally define equivalence between argumentation systems is not the topic of the present paper; for more details the reader is invited to consult the literature on this subject (Amgoud, Besnard, & Vesic, 2011).\nThe second possibility is to do the converse:\n\u2022 for a given attack relationR and semantics x,\n\u2022 start with an argumentation system F = (A,R),\n\u2022 define \u03a3 as the set of all formulae used in the supports of arguments of F , that is, define \u03a3 def = Base(A)\n\u2022 compare the result obtained by using an operator on \u03a3 and the one obtained by calculating the extensions of F\nThe obtained argumentation system may be incomplete, in the sense that A 6= Arg(Base(A)). There is an important difference between those two scenarios. Namely, in the first case, all the arguments that can be built from \u03a3 are considered when calculating Extx(F). In the second case, \u03a3 contains all the formulae fromA, but inF , not all formulae are equally represented. Let us illustrate this situation.\nExample 4. Let R be defined as: for every a, b \u2208 Arg(L), (a, b) \u2208 R if and only if there exists \u03d5 \u2208 Supp(b) such that Conc(a) \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5. Let us use preferred semantics. Let F = (A,R) and A = {a, b} with a = ({\u03d5,\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8}, \u03c8) and b = ({\u00ac\u03d5},\u00ac\u03d5). In this case, since b attacks a and not vice versa, the only extension is E = {b}. Note that the conclusion of the only accepted argument is \u00ac\u03d5. However, if we take \u03a3 to be the union of all formulae used in supports of the arguments of F , we obtain \u03a3 = {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5,\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8}. There are two maximal consistent subsets of this knowledge base: MC(\u03a3) = {{\u03d5,\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8}, {\u00ac\u03d5,\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8}}.\nIt is clear that in a setting similar to that in the previous example, or, more generally, in the second scenario, one cannot expect Arg to be a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Ext(A,R). But, what does an incomplete argumentation system stand for? How is it obtained? To conclude that a system such that A 6= Arg(Base(A)) is meaningless would certainly be too hasty. Let us consider this question in more detail. Namely, we know that \u201cmissing\u201d arguments can be added by an intelligent agent. Should we first add all the \u201cmissing\u201d arguments and then calculate the extensions of the complete version of our system? There are two possible answers: (1) yes, we must add missing arguments in order to take into account all available information; (2) no, since we are given an argumentation system and not all arguments have been constructed (in case of monological argumentation) or uttered (in the case of dialogical argumentation). Both arguments (1) and (2) make sense in different applications: the first possibility corresponds to a case when we want to simulate a resource unbounded agent, and take into account all the information (where \u201cinformation\u201d is seen as\nformulae) known by agent(s). Note that this has its disadvantages since by doing so, we ignore the argumentational representation of the problem. The second possibility is to be used when we want to know what the output of an argumentation system is, where we do take into account the fact that not all arguments are constructed (e.g. because of the lack of computational resources, or since the given argumentation framework is representing a dialogue in which not everything has been said).\nNote that numerous works in the 1990s (Pollock, 1992; Vreeswijk, 1997; Loui, 1998) yield conceptual and philosophical arguments supporting partial computation (i.e. incomplete systems). An important part of Vreeswijk\u2019s (1997) work is devoted to defining and constructing complete argumentation systems. Loui (1998) discusses the philosophical difference between demonstrative reasoning and non-demonstrative reasoning and claims that in a realistic (i.e. resource-bounded) setting, not all reasons are demonstrative, and that process and disputation are essential to reasoning. Note, however, that none of those frameworks is an instantiation of Dung\u2019s system, and that formalisations in those works differ a lot from the framework we studied in this paper. The goal of the present paper is not to argue that complete systems are in any sense \u201cbetter\u201d than incomplete ones (or vice versa), but only to study the possibilities and limits related to instantiating Dung\u2019s abstract theory. We will not further analyse the difference between complete and incomplete systems, but we find it necessary to point out that they exist, in order to make the context of our research question clear. In the second scenario, it is not reasonable to expect any correlation between the result obtained directly from \u03a3 and from F . That is why, in the rest of the paper we suppose the first scenario."}, {"heading": "4. Properties of Relations Satisfying (MC\u2194Ext)", "text": "In this section, we analyse properties of attack relations satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext).

It is known that direct undercut satisfies (MC\u2194 Exts) (Cayrol, 1995). From Proposition 1, we see that for every \u03a3, for every S \u2208 MC(\u03a3), it holds that S = Base(Arg(S)) and, more interestingly, that for every E \u2208 Exts(Arg(\u03a3),Rdu), we have that E = Arg(Base(E)).\nThe previous result allows to easily show that if an attack relation satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext), then every extension has a consistent base and the union of its arguments\u2019 conclusions is consistent.\nCorollary 1. Let R be an attack relation and x a semantics. Let R satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx) and let \u03a3 be a finite set of formulae. Denote F = (Arg(\u03a3),R). Then, for every E \u2208 Extx(F), we have:\n\u2022 Base(E) is consistent \u2022 \u22c3\na\u2208E Conc(a) is consistent\nProof. Let E \u2208 Extx(F). Since R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx), then there exists S \u2208 MC(\u03a3) such that E = Arg(S). From Proposition 1, we obtain E = Arg(Base(E)). Since Arg is an injective function, for every S\u2032 \u2208 MC(\u03a3), if E = Arg(S\u2032) then S = S\u2032. Thus, S = Base(E). Consequently, Base(E) is a consistent set. It is clear that for every argument a \u2208 E , we have that Base(E) ` Conc(a). Since Base(E) is consistent, then \u22c3 a\u2208E Conc(a) is consistent as well.\nNote that we can use the previous result to show that an attack relation does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext). Namely, if an attack relation returns extensions having inconsistent bases, then it violates (MC\u2194 Ext).\nCorollary 2. Let R be an attack relation, and x an acceptability semantics. If there exists a finite knowledge base \u03a3 such that there exists an extension E \u2208 Extx(Arg(\u03a3),R) such that Base(E) is inconsistent, thenR does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx)."}, {"heading": "4.1 On Conflict-Dependence and Validity", "text": "In this subsection, we study the link between satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext) and conflict-dependence and validity. An attack relation is conflict-dependent if whenever an argument attacks another one, the union of their supports is inconsistent (Amgoud & Besnard, 2009).\nDefinition 6 (Conflict-dependent). LetR \u2286 Arg(L)\u00d7Arg(L) be an attack relation. We say thatR is conflict-dependent if and only if for every a, b \u2208 Arg(L), if (a, b) \u2208 R then Supp(a)\u222a Supp(b) ` \u22a5.\nWe now prove that conflict-dependence is a necessary condition for satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext). To be completely precise, we here specify that we say that a semantics x returns conflict-free sets if and only if for every argumentation system (A,R), for every E \u2208 Extx(A,R), it holds that E is conflict-free with respect toR. All the semantics from Definition 4 return conflict-free sets.\nProposition 2. Let R be an attack relation and x a semantics returning conflict-free sets. If R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx), thenR is conflict-dependent.\nProof. Let us suppose the contrary, i.e. letR be an attack relation that is not conflict-dependent, let \u03a3 be a knowledge base and let a, b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) with aRb and Supp(a) \u222a Supp(b) being consistent. Thus, there exists a set S \u2208 MC(\u03a3) such that Supp(a)\u222aSupp(b) \u2286 S. SinceR satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx) then E = Arg(S) is an extension of the corresponding argumentation system F = (Arg(\u03a3),R). This means that a, b \u2208 E . Contradiction with the assumption that x returns conflict-free extensions. Thus,R must be conflict-dependent.\nHaving proved this, we know that a relation satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext) enjoys all the properties of conflict-dependent relations. For example, it was shown that if an attack relation is conflictdependent, then there are no self-attacking arguments (Amgoud & Besnard, 2009).\nCorollary 3. LetR be an attack relation and x a semantics returning conflict-free sets. IfR satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx) then for every argument a \u2208 Arg(L), we have that such that (a, a) /\u2208 R.\nProof. From Proposition 2, we have that R is conflict-dependent. Then, there are no self-attacking arguments (Amgoud & Besnard, 2009, Prop. 4).\nThis means that we have another way to identify (some of the) attack relations not satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext): namely, if for an attack relation there exists a self-attacking argument, then the given attack relation falsifies (MC\u2194 Ext) for all semantics returning conflict-free sets. Let us now study the notion of validity (Amgoud & Besnard, 2010).\nDefinition 7 (Valid). Let R \u2286 Arg(L) \u00d7 Arg(L) be an attack relation. We say that R is valid if and only if for every E \u2286 Arg(L) it holds that if E is conflict-free, then Base(E) is consistent.\nLet us now show that this property is incompatible with conflict-dependence.\nProposition 3. There exists no attack relation which is both conflict-dependent and valid.\nProof. Let R be an attack relation and suppose that R is both conflict-dependent and valid. Let a = ({\u03d5}, \u03d5), b = ({\u00ac\u03c8},\u00ac\u03c8), c = ({\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8},\u00ac\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) and let E = {a, b, c}. Since R is valid and Base(E) is inconsistent, then E is not conflict-free. Since R is conflict-dependent, then (a, b) /\u2208 R, (b, a) /\u2208 R, (a, c) /\u2208 R, (c, a) /\u2208 R, (b, c) /\u2208 R, (c, b) /\u2208 R. Thus, E is conflict-free. Contradiction.\nThis means that if an attack relationR satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) then there must exist a set E which is conflict-free with respect toR but whose base is inconsistent.\nCorollary 4. Let R be an attack relation and x an acceptability semantics returning conflict-free sets and letR satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx). Then,R is not valid.\nThe proof of the previous fact is a consequence of Proposition 2 and Proposition 3. It is useful since if an attack relation is valid, we can immediately conclude that it violates (MC\u2194 Extx) for all (possible) semantics returning conflict-free sets.\nOn the more general level, we see that asking for every conflict-free set to have a consistent base is very demanding. Roughly speaking, this is due the fact that attacks are binary whereas minimal conflicts may be ternary (or of a greater cardinality). Some authors argue that to obtain a consistent result, one should concentrate on admissibility and not on conflict-freeness. For example, Caminada and Vesic (2012) claim that n-ary attacks, for n \u2265 3, are \u201csimulated\u201d in Dung\u2019s framework throughout the notion of admissibility. Thus, an idea for future work could be to study an alternative condition, which is that every admissible set has a consistent base."}, {"heading": "4.2 Satisfying (MC\u2194Ext) and Different Acceptability Semantics", "text": "In this subsection, we study the properties related to particular semantics. We show that if an attack relation satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable semantics, then it satisfies it for semi-stable semantics also. Then we identify conditions under which an attack relation satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable semantics. We provide a similar result for preferred semantics. We also identify a sufficient condition so that an attack relation falsifies (MC\u2194 Ext) under complete semantics. Then, we discuss the case of single-extension semantics, like grounded and ideal.\nFirst, suppose thatR satisfies (MC\u2194 Exts). This means that for every finite set of formulae \u03a3, function Arg is a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Exts(Arg(\u03a3),R). Since every finite set of formulae has at least one maximal consistent subset (even if that is the empty set) then for every \u03a3, it must be that (Arg(\u03a3),R) has at least one stable extension. Since there are stable extensions, then stable and semi-stable semantics coincide (Caminada, 2006). Thus, we obtain the following proposition.\nProposition 4. LetR be an attack relation. IfR satisfies (MC\u2194 Exts) then:\n\u2022 for every finite set of formulae \u03a3 and F = (Arg(\u03a3),R), we have that Exts(F) = Extss(F)\n\u2022 R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extss).\nLet us now prove that in the case of stable semantics, if the image with respect to Arg of every maximal consistent set is an extension and if the base of every extension is consistent, then the attack relation in question satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext).\nProposition 5. Let R be an attack relation. If for every set of formulae \u03a3 and F = (Arg(\u03a3),R), we have:\n\u2022 for all S \u2208 MC(\u03a3), Arg(S) \u2208 Exts(F), and\n\u2022 for all E \u2208 Exts(F), Base(E) is consistent\nthenR satisfies (MC\u2194 Exts).\nProof. Let us prove that R satisfies (MC\u2194 Exts). We already know that for every S \u2208 MC(\u03a3), Arg(S) \u2208 Exts(F). Let us suppose that E \u2208 Exts(F) and let us prove that there exists a unique set S \u2208 MC(\u03a3) such that Arg(S) = E . If we prove that such a set exists, then uniqueness is guaranteed since for S, S\u2032 \u2286 \u03a3, if S 6= S\u2032 then Arg(S) 6= Arg(S\u2032) trivially holds. Thus, let us prove that there exists S \u2208 MC(\u03a3) such that Arg(S) = E . Let S\u2032 = Base(E) and let us prove that S\u2032 \u2208 MC(\u03a3)\nand Arg(S\u2032) = E . By means of contradiction, suppose that S\u2032 is a consistent but not maximal consistent set. Then, there exists S\u2032\u2032 \u2208 MC(\u03a3) such that S\u2032 \u2286 S\u2032\u2032. From the assumptions of this proposition, we have that E \u2032\u2032 = Arg(S\u2032\u2032) is a stable extension of F . But we also have E ( E \u2032\u2032. Since no stable extension is a proper subset of another stable extension, then E is not a stable extension. Contradiction. Thus, it must be that S\u2032 \u2208 MC(\u03a3). It is easy to see that E \u2286 Arg(Base(E)) (namely, for every set of arguments, by applying the function Arg on its base, we obtain its superset). Let us prove Arg(S\u2032) = E . Suppose the contrary. Then, E ( Arg(S\u2032). Since S\u2032 \u2208 MC(\u03a3) then Arg(S\u2032) \u2208 Exts(F). Thus, E is not a stable extension (since no stable extension is a proper subset of another stable extension).\nWe prove that similar two conditions are sufficient to guarantee that R satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) under preferred semantics.\nProposition 6. Let R be an attack relation. If for every set of formulae \u03a3 and F = (Arg(\u03a3),R), we have:\n\u2022 for all S \u2208 MC(\u03a3), Arg(S) \u2208 Extp(F), and\n\u2022 for all E \u2208 Extp(F), Base(E) is consistent\nthenR satisfies (MC\u2194 Extp).\nProof of this property is similar to the proof of Proposition 5. As a consequence of the two previous results, we can identify a sufficient condition so that R\nsatisfies both (MC\u2194 Exts) and (MC\u2194 Extp).\nCorollary 5. LetR be an attack relation. If for every set of formulae \u03a3 and F = (Arg(\u03a3),R), we have:\n\u2022 for all S \u2208 MC(\u03a3), Arg(S) \u2208 Exts(F), and\n\u2022 for all E \u2208 Extp(F), Base(E) is consistent\nthenR satisfies both (MC\u2194 Exts) and (MC\u2194 Extp).\nProof. Since every stable extension is a preferred one (Dung, 1995), it is clear thatR satisfies both conditions of Proposition 5 and Proposition 6. By applying those propositions, we have that R satisfies (MC\u2194 Exts) and (MC\u2194 Extp).\nLet us now show that if an attack relation returns a stable extension having an inconsistent base, then it violates (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics.\nProposition 7. Let R be an attack relation. If there exists a finite set of formulae \u03a3 such that F = (Arg(\u03a3),R) has a stable extension E such that Base(E) is inconsistent, then R falsifies (MC\u2194 Extx) for x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c}.\nProof. We supposed that there exists a stable extension E \u2208 Exts(F) such that Base(E) ` \u22a5. It has been proved (Dung, 1995) that every stable extension is a preferred and a complete one. We also know (Caminada, 2006) that E must be a semi-stable extension. By using Corollary 2, we conclude thatR does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics.\nLet us now study the case of complete semantics. We show that it is not possible for an attack relation to satisfy (MC\u2194 Extc). The only condition we use in our result is that for every argument a, if a has a formula \u03d5 in its support, and \u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3, then there exists an argument b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) such that b attacks a.\nProposition 8. Let R be an attack relation such that for every finite set of formulae \u03a3, for every a \u2208 Arg(\u03a3), for every \u03d5 \u2208 Supp(a), if there exists \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a3 such that \u03c8 \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 then there exists b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) such that (b, a) \u2208 R. Then,R does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Extc).\nProof. We prove that if an attack relation R satisfies the condition from this proposition, then it falsifies (MC\u2194 Extc). We use the proof by contradiction. In other words, the plan of the proof is as follows: first, we suppose that R satisfies the given condition. Second, by means of contradiction, we suppose that R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extc). Third, we draw conclusions and obtain a contradiction. Fourth, by reductio ad absurdum, we conclude that it must be thatR falsifies (MC\u2194 Extc).\nSo, let us start by supposing the condition from the proposition and suppose that R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extc). Thus, from Proposition 2, we obtain the R is conflict-dependent. Since R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extc), then for every \u03a3, Arg is a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Extc(Arg(\u03a3),R). Consider \u03a3 = {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5,\u03c8} and denote F = (Arg(\u03a3),R). It is clear that MC(\u03a3) = {S1, S2} with S1 = {\u03d5,\u03c8} and S2 = {\u00ac\u03d5,\u03c8}. Since R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extc) then Extc(F) = {E1, E2} with E1 = Arg(S1) and E2 = Arg(S2).\nLet us now obtain a contradiction by proving that E3 = Arg({\u03c8}) is a complete extension. First, prove that this set is conflict-free. Let a, b \u2208 E3. Since R is conflict-dependent, then (a, b) /\u2208 R. Thus, E3 is conflict-free.\nLet us now prove that for all a \u2208 E3, for all b \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) \\ E3, we have that (a, b) /\u2208 R and (b, a) /\u2208 R. By means of contradiction, suppose the contrary. Again from conflict-dependence, we have that Supp(a)\u222aSupp(b) ` \u22a5. It must be that {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5} \u2286 Supp(a)\u222aSupp(b). Since the support of every argument is consistent, then Supp(a) contains either \u03d5 or \u00ac\u03d5. Contradiction with the fact a \u2208 Arg({\u03c8}). Thus, E3 is an admissible set.\nLet us now prove that E3 does not defend any arguments in Arg(\u03a3) \\ E3. To show this, we only need to prove that every argument in Arg(\u03a3) \\ E3 is attacked by at least one argument. Note that for every a \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) \\ E3, it holds that a \u2208 E1 \\ E2 or a \u2208 E2 \\ E1. Without loss of generality, let a \u2208 E1 \\ E2. Let us prove that a is attacked. Note that in every argumentation system, every non-attacked argument is in all complete extensions. Since a /\u2208 E2, then amust be attacked. To sum up:\n\u2022 E3 is an admissible set\n\u2022 E3 does not attack any argument in Arg(\u03a3) \\ E3\n\u2022 Arg(\u03a3) \\ E3 does not attack any argument in E3\n\u2022 every argument in Arg(\u03a3) \\ E3 is attacked by at least one argument.\nThus, E3 is a complete extension. Contradiction with the claim that Extc(F) = {E1, E2}. By reductio ad absurdum, we conclude thatR does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Extc).\nWhat about the semantics which always return a unique extension, like grounded and ideal semantics? In such a case, it is not reasonable to expect that there is a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and\nthe set of extensions, since there can be several maximal consistent subsets of \u03a3. Let us formally state this fact.\nProposition 9. If x is a semantics such that for every argumentation systemF we have |Extx(F)| = 1 then there is no attack relationR which satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx).\nProof. Let \u03a3 = {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5,\u03c8}. Denote F = (Arg(\u03a3),R). There are two maximal consistent subsets of \u03a3, i.e. |MC(\u03a3)| = 2. Since we supposed that every argumentation system has exactly one extension under semantics x, then there is no bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Extx(F).\nThe previous simple result is not surprising. The idea between those semantics is to have one extension that contains all the arguments that should be accepted according to every point of view. Thus, we can expect a link between the set of formulae not belonging to any minimal inconsistent set and those extensions. Note that the sufficient conditions for R were identified (Gorogiannis & Hunter, 2011) so that for every finite set \u03a3 and F = (Arg(\u03a3),R) we have that the grounded and the ideal semantics coincide and that the extension is exactly Arg(\u03a3 \\ (\u03a61 \u222a . . . \u222a \u03a6k)) where {\u03a61, . . . ,\u03a6k} is the set of all minimal (for set inclusion) inconsistent subsets of \u03a3."}, {"heading": "5. Identifying Classes of Attack Relations (Not-)Satisfying (MC\u2194Ext)", "text": "The previous sections show how to identify properties that an attack relation satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext) must satisfy. They also provide several results closely related to the choice of a specific acceptability semantics. In this section, we identify classes of attack relations which satisfy, do not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext), or serve as lower (upper) bounds (with respect to set inclusion) for (non-)satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext).\nWe first show that the whole class of symmetric attack relations violates (MC\u2194 Ext) for all semantics from Definition 4.\nProposition 10. IfR is a symmetric attack relation, then for every x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c, g, i},R falsifies (MC\u2194 Extx).\nProof. From Proposition 9, we see that R violates (MC\u2194 Extg) and (MC\u2194 Exti). Let us now prove the same for other acceptability semantics.\nIf R is a symmetric attack relation, then every conflict-free set is admissible. Furthermore, it is easy to see that in this case every maximal conflict-free set is a stable extension (and vice versa). Since every finite argumentation system has at least one maximal conflict-free set, then every finite argumentation system using a symmetric attack relation has at least one stable extension. Let R be a symmetric relation and suppose that for at least one x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c}, R satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx). From Corollary 4, we conclude thatR is not valid. This means that there exists a finite propositional knowledge base \u03a3 and F = (Arg(\u03a3),R) such that there is a conflict-free set E \u2286 Arg(\u03a3) having an inconsistent base. Let E \u2032 \u2286 Arg(\u03a3) be a maximal conflict-free set containing E , i.e. such that E \u2286 E \u2032. Since E \u2032 is a maximal conflict-free set, then it is a stable extension of F . Since E \u2032 is a stable extension, then it is also a semi-stable, preferred and a complete one. Since Base(E \u2032) ` \u22a5 then Corollary 2 implies that for all x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c},R fails to satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx).\nWe now identify another class of attack relations that do not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext). Namely, we show that every (possible) attack generating \u201ctoo many attacks\u201d falsifies (MC\u2194 Ext). First, we\nneed to formally define what we mean by \u201ctoo many attacks\u201d. We do this by introducing the notion of conflict-completeness.\nDefinition 8 (Conflict-complete). Let R \u2286 Arg(L) \u00d7 Arg(L) be an attack relation. We say that R is conflict-complete if and only if for every minimal conflict C \u2286 L (i.e. for every inconsistent set whose every proper subset is consistent), for every C1, C2 \u2286 C such that C1 6= \u2205, C2 6= \u2205, C1 \u222a C2 = C, for every argument a1 such that Supp(a1) = C1, there exists an argument a2 such that Supp(a2) = C2 and (a2, a1) \u2208 R.\nIntuitively, an attack relation is conflict-complete if when two sets form a minimal conflict, then every argument built from one of the two sets can be attacked by an argument from the other set. This notion is inspired by the desire to describe properties of a class of existing (and new) attack relations. For example, canonical undercut is conflict-complete.\nWe can show that if an attack relation is conflict-complete, then it falsifies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics.\nProposition 11. Let R be an attack relation. If R is conflict-complete then R does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx) for x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c}.\nProof. LetR be a conflict-complete attack relation and let us use the proof by contradiction. Thus, suppose that there exist x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c} such thatR satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx) and obtain a contradiction. From Proposition 2, we have that R is conflict-dependent. Let \u03a3 = {\u03d5,\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8,\u00ac\u03c8}. Let F = (Arg(\u03a3),R) and E = Arg({\u03d5}) \u222a Arg({\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8}) \u222a Arg({\u00ac\u03c8}). We prove that E is a stable extension of F . First, prove that E is conflict-free. Let a, b \u2208 E and suppose (a, b) \u2208 R. From conflict-dependence, we obtain Supp(a) \u222a Supp(b) ` \u22a5. Contradiction with the definition of E , since there are no two arguments of E such that the union of their supports is inconsistent. Now, prove that E attacks every argument in Arg(\u03a3) \\ E . Let a\u2032 \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) \\ E . There are three cases. Case 1: Supp(a\u2032) = {\u03d5,\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8}. In this case, since R is conflict-complete, then a\u2032 is attacked by at least one argument from the set Arg(\u00ac\u03c8). Case 2: Supp(a\u2032) = {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03c8}. Again from conflictcompleteness, such an argument is attacked by an argument from the set Arg({\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8}). Case 3: Supp(a\u2032) = {\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8,\u00ac\u03c8} is also similar, since a\u2032 is then attacked by an argument having support {\u03d5}. We conclude that E \u2208 Exts(F). It is easy to see that Base(E) ` \u22a5. Proposition 7 now implies thatR does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx) for every x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c}. Contradiction.\nThe previous part of this paper studies classes of attack relations. Let us now define some particular cases of attack relations. If \u03a6 = {\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5k} is a set of formulae, notation \u2227 \u03a6 stands for \u03d51 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03d5k.\nDefinition 9 (Attack relations). Let a, b \u2208 Arg(L). We define the following attack relations:\n\u2022 defeat: aRdb if and only if Conc(a) ` \u2227 \u00acSupp(b)\n\u2022 direct defeat: aRddb if and only if there exists \u03d5 \u2208 Supp(b) such that Conc(a) ` \u00ac\u03d5 \u2022 undercut: aRub if and only if there exists \u03a6 \u2286 Supp(b) such that Conc(a) \u2261 \u00ac \u2227 \u03a6\n\u2022 direct undercut: aRdub if and only if there exists \u03d5 \u2208 Supp(b) such that Conc(a) \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 \u2022 canonical undercut: aRcub if and only if Conc(a) \u2261 \u00ac \u2227 Supp(b)\n\u2022 rebut: aRrb if and only if Conc(a) \u2261 \u00acConc(b)\n\u2022 defeating rebut: aRdrb if and only if Conc(a) ` \u00acConc(b)\n\u2022 conflicting attack: aRcb if and only if Supp(a) \u222a Supp(b) ` \u22a5\n\u2022 rebut + direct undercut: aRrdub if and only if aRrb or aRdub\n\u2022 big argument attack: aRbab if and only if there exists \u03d5 \u2208 Supp(b) such that Supp(a) ` \u00ac\u03d5.\nThe first seven items from the previous definition list are, to the best of our knowledge, all the attack relations used in the logic-based argumentation literature. Finding the exact paper in which each of them occurs for the first time would be quite a challenging task. We can say that rebut was defined by Pollock (1987, 1992). Direct undercut was introduced in the work of Elvang-G\u00f8ransson, Fox, and Krause (1993) and Elvang-G\u00f8ransson and Hunter (1995). Undercut and canonical undercut were defined in this form by Besnard and Hunter (2000, 2001). To the best of our knowledge, conflicting attack was not used in the argumentation literature. A possibility to use such a relation was mentioned (Besnard & Hunter, 2008, p. 35). We show that it is \u201cnot enough\u201d to capture the presence of inconsistency to make a good attack relation. Namely, we show later that this attack relation may return inconsistent extensions. Rebut + direct undercut is added by the author of the present paper, as an attempt to investigate the possibility to use rebut to detect some conflicts not detected by direct undercut, but to avoid using a symmetric relation (rebut). The name big argument attack and the idea behind this attack relation are due to L. van der Torre (personal communication, June 18, 2012). This attack relation was coined with the goal to show that there are reasonable attack relations not taking into account the conclusion of an argument. We later show (Proposition 16) that this attack relation also satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext). (The idea behind the name of this attack relation is that it is sufficient to use only one argument per support since the conclusions are not important. Those arguments are called big since one big argument plays a role of a whole class of \u201cnormal\u201d arguments, i.e. all the arguments having the same support. The attack relation is called big since it is to be used between big arguments.)\nThe reader can easily check that canonical undercut is conflict-complete, which leads to the conclusion that every attack relation containing canonical undercut (in the set-theoretic sense) is also conflict-complete.\nProposition 12. Let R \u2286 Arg(L) \u00d7 Arg(L) be an attack relation. If Rcu \u2286 R then R is conflictcomplete.\nThus, from Proposition 11, we conclude that every attack relation containing canonical undercut falsifies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics.\nCorollary 6. Let R be an attack relation. If Rcu \u2286 R, then R does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Extx) for x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c}.\nSinceRcu \u2286 Ru \u2286 Rd \u2286 Rc, then we obtain that as soon as an attack relationR containsRu, orRd orRc then it falsifies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics.\nCorollary 7. Let R be an attack relation. If Ru \u2286 R, or Rd \u2286 R or Rc \u2286 R then R falsifies (MC\u2194 Extx) for x \u2208 {s, ss, p, c}.\nHence, there is a whole class of attack relations based on undercutting which do not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext). We also identified another class of attack relations, this time based on rebutting, which do not satisfy (MC\u2194 Exts). Namely, every attack relation contained in defeating rebut must falsify (MC\u2194 Exts). Observe how the proof of the following proposition is based on the idea from Example 3.\nProposition 13. LetR be an attack relation. IfR \u2286 Rdr thenR does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Exts).\nProof. Let us suppose the contrary, i.e. let R satisfy (MC\u2194 Exts). Let \u03a3 = {\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8,\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8} and F = (Arg(\u03a3),R). We have that MC(\u03a3) = {S1, S2}, with S1 = {\u03d5\u2227\u03c8} and S2 = {\u03d5\u2227\u00ac\u03c8}. Thus, it must be that Exts(F) = {E1, E2} with E1 = Arg(S1) and E2 = Arg(S2). It is obvious that for an argument a1 = ({\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8}, \u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8) we must have a1 \u2208 E1. Since E2 is a stable extension, then there must exist an argument a2 \u2208 E2 such that (a2, a1) \u2208 R. Thus, it must be that Conc(a2) ` \u00ac\u03d5\u2227\u00ac\u03c8. Consequently, Conc(a2) ` \u00ac\u03d5. Recall that Supp(a2) = {\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8} or Supp(a2) = {\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8}. Contradiction.\nSinceRr \u2286 Rdr then the previous conclusion holds for every relation contained inRr.\nCorollary 8. LetR be an attack relation. IfR \u2286 Rr thenR does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Exts).\nProof. Let R \u2286 Rr. Since Rr \u2286 Rdr, then R \u2286 Rdr. From Proposition 13, R falsifies (MC\u2194 Exts)."}, {"heading": "6. Particular Attack Relations and (MC\u2194Ext)", "text": "In the previous section, we identified classes of relations which do not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext). In this section, we examine in detail all the attack relations from Definition 9.\nBy using the results presented until now, we prove that direct undercut, direct defeat and big argument attack satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable and preferred semantics, and falsify it for other semantics, whereas other attack relations fail to satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext) for any semantics.\nNote that it has been proved (Cayrol, 1995) that direct undercut satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) in the case of stable semantics. From Proposition 4, we conclude that direct undercut satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for semi-stable semantics. So, we only need to prove that Rdu satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) in the case of preferred semantics.\nProposition 14. Attack relationRdu satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx) for x \u2208 {s, ss, p}.\nProof. We have already seen why Rdu satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) under stable and semi-stable semantics. We now study the case of preferred semantics. Let \u03a3 be a finite set of formulae and F = (Arg(\u03a3),Rdu). Since it was already proved (Cayrol, 1995) that stable extensions of F are exactly Arg(S), when S ranges over MC(\u03a3), and since every stable extension is a preferred one, then it is clear that for every S \u2208 MC(\u03a3) we have that Arg(S) is a preferred extension of F . Thanks to Proposition 6, we now only need to prove that the base of every preferred extension is consistent. This result follows from Prop. 34 by Gorogiannis and Hunter (2011), since relation Rdu satisfies all the conditions of that proposition. Thus, direct undercut satisfies (MC\u2194 Extp).\nExample 6. Consider a relation ; for inferring from an inconsistent knowledge base defined as follows: given a set \u03a3, we write \u03a3 ; \u03d5 if and only if for every maximal consistent subset S of \u03a3, it\nholds that S ` \u03d5, where ` stands for classical entailment. Now, consider an argumentation system using direct undercut as attack relation and stable semantics. From Proposition 14, we conclude that for every \u03a3, Arg is a bijection between MC(\u03a3) and Exts(Arg(\u03a3),Rdu). Roughly speaking, this means that the set of formulae that can be inferred from \u03a3 with respect to ; is equal to the set of formulae that are conclusions of all the extensions of the corresponding argumentation framework based on direct undercut and stable semantics. More formally: for every \u03a3 \u2286 L, for every formula \u03d5 \u2208 L we have that: \u03a3 ; \u03d5 if and only if for every extension E \u2208 Exts(Arg(\u03a3),Rdu), there exists a \u2208 E such that \u03d5 = Conc(a).\nLet us now show that Rdd also satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable and preferred semantics.\nProposition 15. Attack relationRdd satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx) for x \u2208 {s, ss, p}.\nProof. Let \u03a3 be a finite knowledge base and F = (Arg(\u03a3),Rdd). Let S \u2208 MC(\u03a3). It is easy to see that E = Arg(S) is a stable extension of F . Namely, E is conflict-free since Rdd is conflictdependent. Furthermore, for every argument a\u2032 \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) \\ E , it must be that Supp(a\u2032) contains at least one formulae \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a3 \\ S. From this fact, it is easy to conclude that there exists an argument a \u2208 E such that Supp(a) \u2286 S and Conc(a) \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 (since S is a maximal consistent set). Thus, a attacks a\u2032 which ends this part of the proof and shows why E \u2208 Exts(F). Since every stable extension is a semi-stable and a preferred one, then E \u2208 Extss(F) and E \u2208 Extp(F). Let us now suppose that E is a preferred extension of F . Since direct defeat satisfies conditions of Prop. 34 by Gorogiannis and Hunter (2011), then we conclude that Base(E) is consistent. From Corollary 5, we conclude that Rdd satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable and preferred semantics. Now, Proposition 4 implies thatRdd also satisfies (MC\u2194 Extss).\nWe now show that it is not necessary to look at conclusions of arguments in order to satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext). Namely, we can show that big argument attack satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semistable and preferred semantics.\nProposition 16. Attack relationRba satisfies (MC\u2194 Extx) for x \u2208 {s, ss, p}.\nProof. Let us first show that for every S \u2208 MC(\u03a3), it holds that E = Arg(S) is a stable extension in F = (Arg(\u03a3),Rba). Since Rba is conflict-dependent, then E is conflict-free. Let a\u2032 \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) \\ E and let us prove that there exists a \u2208 E such that aRbaa\u2032. Since a\u2032 /\u2208 E , then there exists \u03d5 \u2208 Supp(a\u2032) such that \u03d5 /\u2208 S. Since S is a maximal consistent subset of \u03a3, then S ` \u00ac\u03d5. Let S\u2032 \u2286 S be a minimal with respect to set inclusion consistent set such that S\u2032 ` \u00ac\u03d5 (such a set exists since S is consistent) and let a = (S\u2032,\u00ac\u03d5). a is an argument since S\u2032 is a minimal consistent set from which \u00ac\u03d5 can be deduced. We see that (a, a\u2032) \u2208 Rba. This means that the image with respect to Arg of every maximal consistent subset of \u03a3 is a stable extension of F . Thus, it is also a semi-stable and a preferred extension of F . Let us now prove that for every \u03a3 and the corresponding F = (Arg(\u03a3),Rba), the base of every preferred extension E of F is a consistent set. Let E \u2208 Extp(F) and S = Base(E). Aiming to a contradiction, suppose the contrary, i.e. let S be an inconsistent set. Let S\u2032 \u2286 S be a minimal (with respect to set inclusion) inconsistent set. Denote S\u2032 = {\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n}. Let a \u2208 E be an argument such that \u03d5n \u2208 Supp(a), and let a\u2032 = (S\u2032 \\ {\u03d5n},\u00ac\u03d5n). It is clear that (a\u2032, a) \u2208 Rba. Since E is a preferred extension, it is conflict-free, thus a\u2032 /\u2208 E . Furthermore, E is admissible, so there must exist b \u2208 E such that (b, a) \u2208 Rba. Since (b, a) \u2208 Rba, then there\nexists i \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} such that Supp(b) ` \u00ac\u03d5i. Since \u03d5i \u2208 S\u2032, then there exists an argument c \u2208 E such that \u03d5i \u2208 Supp(c). According to the definition of Rba, that would mean that b attacks c. Contradiction with the fact that E is conflict-free. So, S must be a consistent set. This shows that for every \u03a3 and the corresponding F = (Arg(\u03a3),Rba), the base of every preferred extension E of F is a consistent set. From Corollary 5, we conclude that Rba satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable and preferred semantics. Now, Proposition 4 implies thatRba also satisfies (MC\u2194 Extss).\nWe already know that no relation satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for the grounded or ideal semantics. By using Proposition 8, it is easy to conclude thatRdu,Rdd andRba falsify (MC\u2194 Extc).\nLet us now prove that the remaining attack relations fromDefinition 9 do not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext) for neither of semantics from Definition 4.\nProposition 17. Attack relations Rd, Ru, Rcu, Rr, Rdr, Rrdu, Rc falsify (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred, complete, grounded and ideal semantics.\nProof. Note that we already showed that no attack relation satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for grounded or ideal semantics. So, in the rest of the proof, we only need to consider stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics.\nLet us first consider the attack relations Rcu, Ru, Rd and Rc. By using Proposition 11, we conclude that those relations violate (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics.\nIt is obvious that relations Rr and Rc are symmetric. Note that Rdr is also symmetric: this comes from the fact that \u03d5 ` \u00ac\u03c8 if and only if \u03d5,\u03c8 ` \u22a5 if and only if \u03c8 ` \u00ac\u03d5. Thus, Proposition 10 yields a conclusion that they do not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext) for neither of the considered acceptability semantics.\nLet us now study the relation Rrdu. Let \u03a3 = {\u03d5,\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8,\u00ac\u03c8} and F = (Arg(\u03a3),Rrdu). Let us define a set E of arguments as follows: E = {a \u2208 Arg(\u03a3) | Conc(a) 6\u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 and Conc(a) 6\u2261 \u00ac(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8) and Conc(a) 6\u2261 \u03c8}.\nProve that E is conflict-free. Let a, b \u2208 E and let aRrdub. Whether aRrb or aRdub is not important, since in both cases, we obtain Supp(a)\u222a Supp(b) ` \u22a5. Contradiction, since there are no two formulae in \u03a3 whose union is an inconsistent set. So E is a conflict-free set.\nSuppose that a\u2032 \u2208 Arg(\u03a3)\\E . So, Conc(a\u2032) \u2261 \u00ac\u03d5 or Conc(a\u2032) \u2261 \u00ac(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8) or Conc(a\u2032) \u2261 \u03c8. In any of those cases, a\u2032 is attacked by at least one argument from E , namely by ({\u03d5}, \u03d5), or by ({\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8}, \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8), or by ({\u00ac\u03c8},\u00ac\u03c8). So, E is a stable extension, and consequently, semi-stable, preferred and complete extension. It is obvious that Base(E) is an inconsistent set, so by Corollary 2 we conclude thatRrdu does not satisfy (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable, semi-stable, preferred and complete semantics."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion, Related and Future Work", "text": "This paper identified and studied the large class of instantiations of Dung\u2019s abstract theory corresponding to the maxi-consistent operator. In other words, we studied the instantiations where every extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base. We proved properties of attack relations belonging to this class: they must be conflict-dependent, must not be valid, must not be conflict-complete, must not be symmetric etc. We also identified some attack relations serving as lower or upper bounds of the class. By using our\nresults, we showed for all existing attack relations from the argumentation literature whether or not they belong to this class. We also showed for the first time that an attack relation not depending on arguments\u2019 conclusions can return reasonable results. Furthermore, we showed that such a relation is a member of (MC\u2194 Ext) class.\nPractical benefits of the work reported in this paper, and more generally, any work devoted to studying the link between a class of instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory and an operator, can be resumed as follows. (I) A case when an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory is shown to correspond to an existing operator.\nFirst, such a work can help to \u201cvalidate\u201d an argumentation-based approach by showing in which cases it returns a result comparable with that of a non argumentation-based approach. The possible criticism of such an instantiation is that it is useless, since one can obtain the same result without using argumentation. But, this is far from being true; namely, argumentation can be used for explanatory purposes. For example, if one wants to know why a certain conclusion is accepted, an argument having that conclusion can be presented. That argument can be attacked by other arguments and so on. Also, it might be possible to construct only a part of the argumentation graph related to the argument in question, thus having a better knowledge representation (i.e. ignoring the parts of the knowledge base unrelated to the argument one wants to concentrate on).\nThe second benefit of this type of work is that it can help to reduce computational complexity by using the simpler approach in the cases when the result obtained by an argumentation-based approaches and a non argumentation-based approaches is the same. Please note that the work in this category (capturing an operator with an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory) is far from being limited to the case of the maxi-consistent operator, as it was shown by Vesic and van der Torre (2012) that there exists a large class of instantiations of the abstract argumentation theory returning a consistent result substantially different from the one returned by the maxi-consistent operator.\n(II) A case when an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory does not correspond to any existing operator. Working on the links between instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory and operators can be even more beneficial in the case when an instantiation of the abstract argumentation theory does not corresponding to any known operator happens to be found. We distinguish three possible situations.\n(a) A case when an instantiation calculates a \u201cuseful\u201d result which can be obtained by an operator, but that operator was unknown until now. In such a case, a new operator is discovered thanks to argumentation. The question is then, in which situations to use argumentative approach, and when to apply the operator? The answer depends on the balance between the need for computational efficiency (which we conjecture is often on the side of the approach directly applying the operator) and the need to represent knowledge in a format that is easy to grasp, argue and justify an accepted piece of knowledge, which are the usual advantages of argumentation.\n(b) A case when an instantiation of Dung\u2019s abstract theory returns a \u201cuseful\u201d result which cannot be obtained by any operator. Recall that an operator is a function that, for every finite knowledge base, returns a set of its subsets. But, an argumentative approach could return a result that cannot be represented in that form, for instance, if an argument (\u03a6, \u03b1) is in an extension, whereas (\u03a6, \u03b2) is not, with \u03b1 6= \u03b2. Thus, the expressive power of the operator-based approach might be not enough to distinguish those subtleties. A very important question of how to define such an instantiation is still open. Another relevant issue is to see in which context such instantiations make sense and how they can be applied.\n(c) A case when an instantiation returns a \u201cbad\u201d result. This class regroups a set of instantiations representing a behaviour one would like to avoid. The general question: \u201chow to distinguish useful from bad instantiations?\u201d is certainly a hard one. Apart from a scientific debate, evaluation can include tests on a set of benchmark examples. Note that the limits of testing a reasoning formalism on a set of benchmark examples have been pointed out by Vreeswijk (1995). Another, more principled (and more demanding) way to proceed is to define a set of postulates to be satisfied by an argumentation formalism (Caminada & Amgoud, 2007; Caminada, Carnielli, & Dunne, 2012).\nAs a remark, note that the fact that an instantiation may return an inconsistent result, does not mean that it is completely useless. Namely, there might be cases when arguments are constructed from an inconsistent knowledge base, and when one resolves just some of the existing inconsistencies by an argumentative approach, and then applies another inconsistency-tolerant approach. Also, inconsistency handling is not the only use of argumentation. Thus, still in the same setting, a drastic case would be to first use argumentation for another purpose (not dealing with at all with inconsistencies) and then apply a different approach to reason with inconsistency.\nWe now review the related work. Maxi-consistent sets play a major role in the characterization of various forms of non-classical logical reasoning (Bochman, 2001) and in belief revision (Alchourro\u0301n, Gardenfors, & Makinson, 1985). The remainder of the section considers the papers having a link with argumentation.\nThe paper by Cayrol (1995) is one of the early works relating the results obtained directly from a knowledge base and by using an argumentative approach. In that paper, it was shown that direct undercut satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext) for stable semantics, but no results for other semantics or attack relations were provided. We not only studied other attack relations and other semantics, but also provided a general study of properties an attack relation satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext) must also satisfy.\nAmgoud and Vesic (2010) generalised the result by Cayrol (1995) for the case of prioritised knowledge base, by showing that Arg is a bijection between preferred sub-theories (Brewka, 1989), which generalise maximal consistent sets in case of prioritised knowledge base, and stable extensions of the corresponding preference-based argumentation system using direct undercut as an attack relation and the weakest link principle as a preference relation.\nAmgoud and Besnard (2009, 2010) also studied the link between a knowledge base and the corresponding argumentation system. Those papers introduced some important notions like conflictdependence and validity of an attack relation and proved numerous results related to consistency in the underlying logic. However, note that the criterion (MC\u2194 Ext) was neither defined nor studied in those papers; they provided (Amgoud & Besnard, 2010, Corollary 1) a link between MC(\u03a3) and maximal conflict-free sets of F = (Arg(\u03a3),R). Furthermore, this result is proved under hypotheses which are impossible to satisfy: the attack relation should be both valid and conflict-dependent, which is impossible (as proved in Proposition 3). Some other results in that paper (Amgoud & Besnard, 2010, e.g. Prop. 4) are proved only for an attack relation which is both conflict-dependent and conflict-sensitive, which is not the case for any of the well-known attack relations. Consequently, the majority of the negative results of those papers are only applicable to a minority of attack relations. Furthermore, examples in those papers are often \u201cincomplete systems\u201d; thus, it is not surprising that there is no link between MC(Base(A)) and Ext(A,R) in those examples.\nA recent paper by Gorogiannis and Hunter (2011) studied the properties of attack relations in the case when a Dung-style argumentation system is instantiated with classical propositional logic. Our work is related to those ideas, however, the focus of our paper is different. Our main goal is to study to which extent Dung\u2019s theory can be used as a general framework for reasoning.\nOn the technical side, we concentrate on studying the properties of the class of attack relations satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext) and identifying attack relations serving as lower and upper bounds of classes of relations non-satisfying (MC\u2194 Ext).\nOne of the open questions is to find a set of conditions such that an attack relation satisfies those conditions if and only if it satisfies (MC\u2194 Ext). Until recently, direct undercut and direct defeat were the only known attack relations satisfying this condition (Vesic, 2012). Consequently, it seemed that the space of attack relations satisfying this condition is rather narrow (note the similarity between direct undercut and direct defeat). However, the present paper shows thatRba also belongs to (MC\u2194 Ext), this indicating that the class of instantiations corresponding to the maxi-consistent operator is much larger.\nThe formal framework studied in this paper is that of classical propositional logic-based argumentation. The vast majority of ideas and considerations from the present paper hold for other instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory, for example in the setting studied by Modgil and Prakken (2013). In other words, the result obtained from those argumentation frameworks could also be compared with that obtained by an operator. After slightly adapting the definition of an operator, one can study the same questions: is there a link between the result obtained from an argumentation system and that obtained by an operator (from the same strict and defeasible rules)? Can argumentation help us find new operators? Are there argumentation systems returning a result that cannot be captured by an operator? Answering those questions will certainly be a part of our future work."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The author would like to thank Leendert van der Torre for his assistance and advice.

(I) A case when an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory is shown to correspond to an existing operator. First, such a work can help to \u201cvalidate\u201d an argumentation-based approach by showing in which cases it returns a result comparable with that of a non argumentation-based approach. The possible criticism of such an instantiation is that it is useless, since one can obtain the same result without using argumentation. But, this is far from being true; namely, argumentation can be used for explanatory purposes. For example, if one wants to know why a certain conclusion is accepted, an argument having that conclusion can be presented. That argument can be attacked by other arguments and so on. Also, it might be possible to construct only a part of the argumentation graph related to the argument in question, thus having a better knowledge representation (i.e. ignoring the parts of the knowledge base unrelated to the argument one wants to concentrate on). The second benefit of this type of work is that it can help to reduce computational complexity by using the simpler approach in the cases when the result obtained by an argumentation-based approaches and a non argumentation-based approaches is the same. Please note that the work in this category (capturing an operator with an instantiation of Dung\u2019s theory) is far from being limited to the case of the maxi-consistent operator, as it was shown by Vesic and van der Torre (2012) that there exists a large class of instantiations of the abstract argumentation theory returning a consistent result substantially different from the one returned by the maxi-consistent operator.", "startOffset": 150, "endOffset": 1648}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "Maxi-consistent sets play a major role in the characterization of various forms of non-classical logical reasoning (Bochman, 2001) and in belief revision (Alchourr\u00f3n, Gardenfors, & Makinson, 1985).", "startOffset": 115, "endOffset": 130}, {"referenceID": 10, "context": "Amgoud and Vesic (2010) generalised the result by Cayrol (1995) for the case of prioritised knowledge base, by showing that Arg is a bijection between preferred sub-theories (Brewka, 1989), which generalise maximal consistent sets in case of prioritised knowledge base, and stable extensions of the corresponding preference-based argumentation system using direct undercut as an attack relation and the weakest link principle as a preference relation.", "startOffset": 174, "endOffset": 188}, {"referenceID": 17, "context": "Note that the limits of testing a reasoning formalism on a set of benchmark examples have been pointed out by Vreeswijk (1995).

Consequently, the majority of the negative results of those papers are only applicable to a minority of attack relations. Furthermore, examples in those papers are often \u201cincomplete systems\u201d; thus, it is not surprising that there is no link between MC(Base(A)) and Ext(A,R) in those examples.

The goal of this paper is to identify and study the large class of logic-based instantiations of Dung\u2019s theory which correspond to the maxi-consistent operator, i.e. to the function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge base. In other words, we study the class of instantiations where every extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base. We show that an attack relation belonging to this class must be conflict-dependent, must not be valid, must not be conflict-complete, must not be symmetric etc. Then, we show that some attack relations serve as lower or upper bounds of the class (e.g. if an attack relation contains canonical undercut then it is not a member of this class). By using our results, we show for all existing attack relations whether or not they belong to this class. We also define new attack relations which are members of this class. Finally, we interpret our results and discuss more general questions, like: what is the added value of argumentation in such a setting? We believe that this work is a first step towards achieving our long-term goal, which is to better understand the role of argumentation and, particularly, the expressivity of logic-based instantiations of Dung-style argumentation frameworks.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
