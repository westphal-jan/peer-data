In other words, whether the secondary observations are plausible in the abductive context of the primary one, is a common scientific reasoning task. Thus, for example, one may attempt to find abductive explanations for such secondary observations strictly within the context of the given abductive explanations found for the primary observation \u2013 that is, disallowing new abductions \u2013 or, nevertheless, allowing additional abductions as long as they are consistent with the primary ones.

We show this type of reasoning requires the characterization of a new abduction concept and mechanism, that of contextual abduction. We examine and formalize its variants, and employ these to understand and justify belief bias of human reasoning in addressing syllogisms.\nOur starting point is a psychological study carried out by Evans et al. (1983) about deductive reasoning which demonstrated possibly conflicting processes in human reasoning. Participants were presented different syllogisms and had to decide whether they were logically valid. Consider one of them, Sadd :\nPREMISE1 No addictive things are inexpensive. PREMISE2 Some cigarettes are inexpensive. CONCLUSION Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes.\nEven though the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises,1 participants assumed the syllogism to be logically valid. They were explicitly asked to logically validate or invalidate these syllogisms, but didn\u2019t seem to have the intellectual capability to do so. Even worse, they were not at all aware about their inabilities. Repeatedly, the majority of people were proffering with certainty of confidence the wrong answer. Evans et al. (1983) concluded that this happened because they were being unduly influenced by their own beliefs, their belief bias. In (Evans 2010; Evans 2012), the conflict between logic and belief in human reasoning is discussed extensively.\nWe will show how the belief bias effect can be explained by abductive reasoning and its corresponding side-effects.

If Step 2 is omitted, then the resulting set is called the weak completion of P (wcP).\nHo\u0308lldobler and Kencana Ramli (2009b) showed that the model intersection property holds for weakly completed programs. This guarantees the existence of a least model for every program. In computational logic, least models can often be computed as least fixed points of an appropriate semantic operator (Apt and van Emden 1982). Stenning and van Lambalgen (2008) devised such an operator which has been generalized for first-order programs by Ho\u0308lldobler and Kencana Ramli (2009a): Let I be an interpretation and \u03a6P(I) = \u3008J\u22a4, J\u22a5\u3009, where\nJ\u22a4= {A |there exists A \u2190 body \u2208 P with I(body) = \u22a4}, J\u22a5= {A |there exists A \u2190 body \u2208 P and for all A \u2190 body \u2208 P we find I(body) = \u22a5}.\nAs shown in (Ho\u0308lldobler and Kencana Ramli 2009a) the least fixed point of \u03a6P is identical to the least model of the weak completion of P (lm\u0141wcP) under three-valued \u0141ukasiewicz semantics. Starting with the empty interpretation I = \u3008\u2205, \u2205\u3009, lm\u0141wcP can be computed by iterating \u03a6P .2\n2 Weak completion semantics corresponds to well-founded semantics (Van Gelder et al. 1991) for tight logic programs (Dietz et al. 2013).\n4"}, {"heading": "3 Reasoning in an Appropriate Logical Form", "text": "Stenning and van Lambalgen (2005; 2008) proposed to model human reasoning by a two step process: Firstly, human reasoning should be modeled by setting up an appropriate representation and, secondly, the reasoning process should be modeled with respect to this representation. In this section we discuss the first step and show how to model syllogisms in logic programs.\n3.1 Integrity Constraints\nPREMISE1 of Sadd is\nNo addictive things are inexpensive. (1)\nand is equivalent to\nIf something is inexpensive, then it is not addictive. (2)\nThe consequence is the negation of something is addictive. As weak completion semantics does not allow negative heads in clauses, for every negative conclusion \u00acp(X) we introduce an auxiliary formula p\u2032(X), which denotes the negation of p and the clause p(X) \u2190 \u00acp\u2032(X).\nWe obtain the following preliminary representation of the first premise of Sadd with regard to addictive: add \u2032(X) \u2190 inex (X), and add(X) \u2190 \u00acadd \u2032(X), where add(X), add \u2032(X), and inex (X) stand for X is addictive, not addictive, and inexpensive.\nWith the introduction of these auxiliary atoms, the need for integrity constraints arises. A least model of the weak completion that contains both add(X) and add \u2032(X) in I\u22a4 should be invalidated as a model in general. This condition can be represented by a set of integrity constraints IC, which contains clauses of the following form: U \u2190 IC Body, where the implication is understood as usual. For our example above, ICadd contains one clause: U \u2190 add(X) \u2227 add \u2032(X). However, the \u03a6 operator does not consider clauses of this form, thus such denial ICs are not evaluated by it. We apply a two step approach to take them into consideration. First, we compute the least model of the given program and second, we verify whether it does satisfy the requirements of the IC. Given an interpretation I and a set of integrity constraints IC, I satisfies IC if and only if all clauses in IC are true under I . For the following examples, whenever there exists a p(X) and its p\u2032(X) counterpart in P , we implicitly assume that ICp: U \u2190 p(X) \u2227 p\u2032(X).3"}, {"heading": "3.2 Abnormalities & Background Knowledge", "text": "A direct representation of PREMISE2 is\nThere exists a cigarette which is inexpensive. (3)\nAdditionally, it is commonly known that\nCigarettes are addictive. (4)\nAs discussed in (Evans et al. 1983), humans seem to have a background knowledge or belief, which, in this context, assuming (4), we imply that\nCigarettes are inexpensive (compared to other addictive things),\n3 This view on ICs corresponds to the definition applied for the well-founded semantics in (Pereira et al. 1991).\n5 which implies (3) and biases the reasoning towards a representation. The preliminary program representing the first two premises, is the non-ground program Ppreadd:\nadd \u2032(X) \u2190 inex (X), add(X) \u2190 \u00acadd \u2032(X), inex(X) \u2190 cig(X), cig(a) \u2190 \u22a4.\nand its corresponding least model is: \u3008{cig(a), inex (a), add \u2032(a)}, {add(a)}\u3009. This model contradicts the commonly known assumption of (4). This background knowledge can be expressed in the program by applying Stenning and van Lambalgen\u2019s idea to implement conditionals by a normal default permission for implications.This can be achieved by adding an abnormality predicate to the antecedent of the implication and initially assuming that the abnormality predicate is false. Following this idea, the initial PREMISE1 in Sadd is extended to:"}, {"heading": "If something is inexpensive and not abnormal, then it is not addictive.", "text": "Nothing (as a rule) is abnormal (regarding (1)).\nThis belief-bias together with the idea to represent conditionals by a normal default permission for implication leading to this rendering\nIf something is a cigarette and not abnormal, then it is inexpensive.

As specified by the classical hypothetic-deductive method (Hempel 1966), scientific inquiry is carried out in three stages: hypotheses generation, prediction, and evaluation. One or more hypotheses may be generated, by abduction, to explain observed events. A generated set of hypotheses (or assumptions) can thence be employed for predicting unseen events by means of deduction, on the implicit condition of not making further abductions (cf. Pereira and Pinto (2011)). The predicted events can then hopefully be tested against reality, in the form of such observable deduced side-effects, in order to evaluate the plausibility of the set of hypotheses.\nAbduction, or inference to the best explanation (its usual designation in the philosophy of science), is a reasoning method whereby one chooses those hypotheses that would, if true, best explain observed evidence or enable to satisfy some query, whilst meeting attending constraints. Abduction has been well studied in the field of computational logic \u2013 and logic programming in particular \u2013 for a few decades now. Abduction, when added to logic programs, offers a formalism to declaratively express problems in a variety of areas and empowers many applications,\n6 e.g. in decision-making, diagnosis, planning, belief revision, and conditional reasoning. In logic programs, abductive hypotheses (or abducibles) are named given atoms of the program which have no rules, and whose truth value is not initially assumed, and hence unknown.\nThe approach presented in (Torasso et al. 1991) treats abduction with completion semantics and does not study side-effects. In the following we consider abduction with weak completion semantics and introduce the examination of side-effects in contexts afforded by abduction."}, {"heading": "4.1 Abductive Framework", "text": "Following Kakas et al. (1993) we consider an abductive framework consisting of a program P as knowledge base, a collection of atoms A of abducibles syntactically represented by the set of the (positive and negative) facts for each undefined ground atom in P , a set of integrity constraints IC, and the logical consequence relation |=lmwc\u0141 , where P |= lmwc \u0141 F if and only if lm\u0141wcP(F ) = \u22a4 for the formula F . An observation is a set of (at least one) literals. The truth value of abducibles may be independently assumed true or false, via either their positive or negated form, as the case may be, in order to produce an abductive explanation for an observation \u2013 or solution to a query \u2013, which is a consistent set of assumed hypotheses in the form of abducibles.\nAn abductive solution is a consistent set of abducible instances that, when substituted by their assigned truth value in P , affords us with a model of P (for the specific semantics used on P), which satisfies the observation (or query) and any imposed integrity constraints \u2013 a so-called abductive model. In our notation this amounts to adding to P the corresponding positive and negative facts representing a solution\u2019s abducibles.\nWhat we dub observation is analogous to a query whose explanation is desired, not necessarily something actually observed.\nDefinition 1 Let \u3008P ,A, IC, |=lmwc\u0141 \u3009 be an abductive framework,O be an observation, and E be an explanation which is a (consistent) subset of A, a set of integrity constraints IC, and the consequence relation |=lmwc\u0141 , defined for all formulas F .\nO is explained by E given P and IC iff P\u222aE |=lmwc\u0141 O, where P 6|= lmwc \u0141 O and lm\u0141wc (P\u222aE)\nsatisfies IC. O is explained given P and IC iff there exists an E such that O is explained by E given P\nand IC.\nIn abduction, as for its deduction counterpart, credulous and skeptical reasoning varieties are distinguished. Credulous reasoning consists in finding if there exists at least one model of the program \u2013 according to some pre-established semantics \u2013 which entails the observation to be explained. Skeptical reasoning demands that every model of the program entails the observation.\nF follows skeptically from P , IC and O iff O can be explained given P and IC, and for all minimal (or some alternative preference criterion instead) explanations E for O it holds that P \u222a E |=lmwc\u0141 F . F follows credulously from P , IC and O iff there exists a minimal (or some alternative preference criterion instead) explanation E for O and it holds that P \u222a E |=lmwc\u0141 F .\nBecause the satisfaction of integrity constraints (ICs) can require abductions, we must allow ICs to be actively productive of abductions, and not just use ICs to subsequently disallow abductive\n7 solutions that invalidate the least model with respect to them. However, we cannot actively promote that an atom is required to be false or else unknown, one of the two, in order for ICs to be satisfied. The only possibility is to impose its falsity: because ICs have the form of denials, we can think of U \u2190 A as just an atom that we wish must never be explained by any explanation.\nAs our underlying semantics is three-valued, we may but might not make each undefined atom an abducible, so that we allow for unknown, non-abducible susceptible knowledge, which can be guaranteed by adding the clause A \u2190 A for the predicate under consideration. Furthermore, when making use of skeptical reasoning, we conclude that an abducible is unknown if it does not have the same binary truth value in all models. For instance consider the program P = {A \u2190 B,A \u2190 C} and observation OA = {A}, for which there are two minimal explanation EB = {B \u2190 \u22a4} and EC = {C \u2190 \u22a4}. Under skeptical reasoning A does not follow from all minimal explanations and thus B and C stay unknown.\nIn previous approaches, weak completion semantics was used for cases expressed in propositional logic, and abduction under skeptical reasoning seemed adequate (Ho\u0308lldobler et al. 2011)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Usual Contextual Abduction", "text": "One important extension of abduction pertains to the issue that, whenever discovering abductive solutions, i.e. explanations, for some given primary observation, one may wish to check too whether some other given additional secondary observations are true, being a logical consequence of the abductive explanations found for the primary observation. In other words, whether the secondary observations are plausible in the abductive context of the primary one. Indeed, often, besides needing to abductively discover which hypotheses to assume in order to satisfy some condition, we may also want to know some of the side-effects of those assumptions.\nWe address the issue of relaxing or loosening the implicit condition about additional abductions not being permitted whilst considering the observable side-effects explained by deductive prediction. In other words, prediction may be allowed recourse to additional assumptions, but nevertheless must make use of at least some of the initial explanations. If several such explanations exist for the observations concerned, then we might want to define alternative conditions that are less strict with regard to each set or to the collection of sets. Reuse of contextual abductions, by resorting to an implementation of tabled abduction for well-founded semantics, is reported in (Saptawijaya and Pereira 2013).\nLet\u2019s consider again Padd , its weak completion consists of the following equivalences:\nadd(a) \u2194 \u00acadd \u2032(a), add \u2032(a) \u2194 inex (a) \u2227 \u00acab1(a), inex (a) \u2194 cig(a) \u2227 \u00acab2(a), ab2(a) \u2194 \u22a5, ab1(a) \u2194 cig(a), 4 cig(a) \u2194 \u22a4.\nIts least model, lm\u0141wcPadd , is \u3008{cig(a), inex (a), add(a), ab1(a)}, {add \u2032(a), ab2(a)}\u3009, from which we cannot derive the CONCLUSION in Sadd . Obviously, the CONCLUSION is something about an object which is not a. The first part of this conclusion is an observation, let\u2019s say about b: Oadd(b) = {add(b)}, which we need to explain as described in the previous subsection. The set of abducibles with respect to b is: APadd = {cig(b) \u2190 \u22a4, cig(b) \u2190 \u22a5}. Oadd(b) is true if add \u2032(b) is false which is false if inex (b) is false or ab1(b) is true. Either inex (b) is false but then cig(b) is false or ab1(b) is true but then cig(b) is true. For Oadd(b) we have two minimal\n4 \u22a5 \u2228 cig(a) is semantically equivalent to cig(a) under \u0141ukasiewicz Semantics.\n8 explanations E\u00accig(b) = {cig(b) \u2190 \u22a5} and Ecig(b) = {cig(b) \u2190 \u22a4}. The corresponding least models of the weak completion are:\nlm\u0141wc (Padd \u222a E\u00accig(b)) = \u3008{. . . , add(b), . . . }, {. . . , cig(b), inex (b), . . . }\u3009, lm\u0141wc (Padd \u222a Ecig(b)) = \u3008{. . . , add(b), cig(b), inex (b), . . . }, {. . . }\u3009.\nUnder credulous reasoning we conclude, given explanation E\u00accig(b), that the CONCLUSION of Sadd is true, as there exists something addictive which is not a cigarette. I.e., there is a least model which abductively explains that an observed addictive b is not a cigarette. However, we could also explain Oadd(b) by Ecig(b), which is an equally justified explanation. We would prefer our formalism to reflect that the first premise describes the usual and the second premise describes the exceptional case. That is, an inexpensive cigarette is meant to be the exception not the rule in the context of things that are addictive. This exceptional case should then only be considered when more is known about b. This preference is not expressed in our framework yet. The following section discusses and proposes a solution to this issue."}, {"heading": "5 Inspection Points", "text": "Until now, we assumed the possible observations as given, and easily identified from the corresponding context which was the exceptional and which the usual case. However, this is not explicitly encoded in our logic programs yet, and needs be syntactically indicated. For this purpose we investigate and apply inspection points, originally presented by Pereira and Pinto (2011).\nIn (Pereira and Pinto 2011), the authors present the concept of inspection points in abductive logic programming and show how one can employ it to investigate side-effects of interest in order to help choose among abductive solutions. In what follows we discuss this approach and show how inspection points can be modeled for our previous examples accordingly, in what concerns abducibles. Given an atom A, we introduce the following two reserved (meta-)predicates:\ninspect(A) and inspect\u00ac(A),\nwhich are special cases of abducibles. They differ from the usual abducibles in the way that they can only be abduced whenever A or \u00acA have been abduced somewhere else already. That is, an abductive solution or explanation E is only valid when for each inspect(A) (respectively inspect\u00ac(A)) it contains, it also contains a corresponding A (respectively \u00acA). That is, in a solution the consumers, here represented by the inspection points inspect(A) and inspect\u00ac(A), respectively, must have a matching producer. The producers correspond to the usual abducibles.\nOne should observe that for a treatment of inspection points for all literals in a program and not just the abducible ones, we would simply need to adopt the program transformation technique of Pereira and Pinto (2011), which recursively relays inspection of non-terminal literals to the base inspection of terminals. Let us consider again the example of Section 4.2 where we stated that we would prefer to distinguish between the usual case and the exceptional case. We can now represent this in our logic program by replacing our ab1-clause accordingly. The new non-ground program, P insp add , is:\n(Padd \\ {ab1(X) \u2190 cig(X)}) \u222a {ab1(X) \u2190 inspect(cig(X))}.\nSuppose, b is addictive, i.e. Oadd(b). As cig(b) is undefined, inspect(cig(b)) becomes false, and ab1(b) will be false rather than unknown, that is, its falsity is obtained because nothing is known about cig(b).

However, we assume that a lightning causing a forest fire is much more unlikely than a barbecue, and therefore, lightning , when not observed directly, only counts as a plausible explanation when it has been abduced by some other observation. This is expressed by inspect(lightning). Assume that we observe a storm and know that nothing is abnormal with respect to ab3, thus the leaves are dry: Ostorm,dry = {storm, dry leaves}.

The idea behind the definition for the possibly contested contextual side-effects, is, that there is at least one explanation E1 for O1 which affords us with one complete explanation under which some incomplete explanation E2 for \u00acO2 is necessarily completed.\nConsider rained \u2190 inspect\u00ac(dry leaves) in Pfire : it states that if, for some other observation we explained that the leaves are not dry, then it rained. Thus, when we observe a forest fire, then, one part of the abduced explanation will be, in any case, independent of whether there was a lightning or a barbecue, that the leaves are dry. However this explanation will lead to\n11\ninspect\u00ac(dry leaves) being false, which makes rained false as well. O\u00acrained is a consequence that follows from the explanation for Offire . According to Definition 3, O\u00acrained is a necessarily contested contextual side-effect of Off given Pfire and ICfire .\nAnother variation of contestable side-effects is abductive rebuttal. In this case, the side-effect directly contradicts an observation. That is to say, it is the case that O2 \u2261 \u00acO1 in Definition 3.

Yet it seems to adequately model another human reasoning task which includes the belief-bias effect. Taking our formalization as starting point, we showed by running examples the need and use for possible extensions in abductive reasoning. Introducing the concept of inspection points in our current framework by applying reserved (meta-)predication for all abductive ground atoms, makes it possible to differentiate between consumed and produced abducibles. This distinction allows us to implement the concepts of contextual side-effect, (jointly supported) contextual relevant consequences and contestable contextual side-effects. Belief bias can thus be modeled using mechanisms described and formalized more abstractly, which deal with contextual abductive reasoning by means of taking side-effects under consideration, applicable to a larger scope of problems, via the notion of inspection points (references to other published examples are given). Our abstract formalism opens therefore the way to a wider use, not restricted to psychological modeling. When examining abductive explanatory plausibility and contextual counterfactual reasoning new questions raise on whether new observations should be explained by possible or by necessary side-effects. They again might explain new and possibly unexpected side-effects. Additionally, we need to explore how to deal with inconsistency. Another aspect is about choosing the most appropriate explanations. In our examples, we follow Occam\u2019s razor with respect to competing explanations, that is, we only consider the minimal explanations. However, there are other measures of preferences which might be more appropriate (e.g. from a human reasoning point of view) and which should be further investigated. In a future extension, some abducibles can be abduced in a three-valued way if we\u2019re trying to make the top goal unknown. This is typical of fault-finding, which concerns two separate problems: (1) finding the abducibles which, if unknown for some faulty components, would make unknown the predicted output using the correct model of the artifact, that happens to be at odds with the faulty output behavior of the artifact; (2) abducing the faulty behavior of components (using a model of the artifact comprising the modeling of faults) to actually predict the faulty behavior. This requires abducing normality of a component as a default, and going back over that normality to change it to unknown, whose technicalities are beyond the scope of this paper. In a psychological modeling case, the artifact we might be aiming to find faults about can be some psychological model. We then may have available some real person\u2019s specific behavior that the model is not consistent with, i.e. it wrongly predicts the negation of that behavior. Consequently, we want at least render our model consistent with that behavior by forcing some abducible or other to be unknown, and thus its specific prediction is unknown, rather than the negation of the person\u2019s behavior. A second step is to improve and correct the model to make the right prediction. This is comparable to introducing a component\u2019s faulty behavior model into a correct model of the artifact, whereas now the faulty artifact is the (incorrect) model, and the missing faulty component model refers to a missing model part that would produce the correct behavior prediction."}, {"heading": "8 Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Pierangelo Dell\u2019Acqua for his comments.

Evans, Barston and Pollard carried out a psychological syllogistic reasoning task to prove this effect. Participants were asked whether they would accept or reject a given syllogism. We discuss one specific case which is commonly assumed to be believable but which is actually not logically valid. By introducing abnormalities, abduction and background knowledge, we adequately model this case under the weak completion semantics. Our formalization reveals new questions about possible extensions in abductive reasoning. For instance, observations and their explanations might include some relevant prior abductive contextual information concerning some side-effect or leading to a contestable or refutable side-effect. A weaker notion indicates the support of some relevant consequences by a prior abductive context. Yet another definition describes jointly supported relevant consequences, which captures the idea of two observations containing mutually supportive side-effects. Though motivated with and exemplified by the running psychology application, the various new general abductive context definitions are introduced here and given a declarative semantics for the first time, and have a much wider scope of application. Inspection points, a concept introduced by Pereira and Pinto, allows us to express these definitions syntactically and intertwine them into an operational semantics.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
