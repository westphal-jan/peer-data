At present, the technology of information extraction has become\nmature already. As a result, the research in biomedicine information extraction is\nbecoming more and more important, and relation extraction is one of the most\nimportant. Not only is it practical by itself, but it is also the foundation of the relation\ndatabase and the biological knowledge network, besides it also plays a key role in the\nrelation prediction and the drug producing. Now, the relation extraction has already\nbecome a hotspot, but there exists some problems, too. For instance, the result is not\ngood enough, and some important information such as direction and type is ignored.\nThis paper did research from two aspects: improving the result and exacting\nmore information about relation, direction for example. Towards the characters of\nbiomedicine literature, we designed some new features, and extracted relation with\nthe good machine learning model SVM, and the experiments showed that the results\nwere good."}, {"heading": "2 Extracting Protein-Protein Interaction", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Problem definition", "text": "Once protein names have been found, the relationships between them need to be\nascertained. The PPI extraction could be defined as a classification problem. When two protein names and one interaction word co-occur in a single sentence, then we could transfer the mission into inferring weather a PPI exist between the pair of proteins. So, firstly, the sentences were filtered by the simple rule that two protein names co-occur in one sentence. Secondly, we used a trained SVM model to solve this classification problem.\nAfter relation extraction, we decided direction of the relation, because the\ndirection is important to construct a biological network. We also transformed this\nproblem into classification."}, {"heading": "2.2 Feature design", "text": "The key point is the design of features.
