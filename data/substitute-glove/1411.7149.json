Introduction", "text": "Human beings usually manage statements or propositions that involve quantities that are more or less well defined. Quantifiers, such as all, few, 25, around 25. . . , are the linguistic particles frequently used to express them. Quantified statements (sentences involving quantifiers) are used both for describing particular aspects of reality (i.e., Most students are young) and also for making inferences; that is, obtaining new information from a given set of premises. This type of reasoning is known as syllogism. Although syllogisms were superseded by propositional logic [1] in the 19th century, it is still matter of research. In this paper, we propose an approach to syllogism involving fuzzy generalized quantifiers that allows the reasoning to be performed with no limits in the number of premises.\n\u2217Corresponding author.

In this case the premises are the quantified statements denoted as PR1 (first premise) and PR2 (second premise) and the conclusion is the quantified statement denoted as C (inferred from the premises). Each one of the quantified statements in the example is made up of two main elements: a quantifier (eight, ten, eighteen or less) and terms (students, Portuguese, young, Portuguese and young), usually interpreted as sets, that describe properties of the elements in a referential universe. The most usual quantified statements are the binary ones; that is, statements involving a single quantifier and two terms. The subject in the sentence is the \u201crestriction\u201d of the quantifier and the predicate its \u201cscope\u201d. For instance, students is the restriction and Portuguese the scope of quantifier eight in PR1 premise of Table 1. The purpose of inference within this context is to calculate consistent values for the quantifier in the conclusion starting from the premises. These values are strongly dependent on the actual distribution of the elements in the referential among the terms1. In the example, the consistent values for the quantifier in the conclusion range from 0, for the case in which none of the eight Portuguese students is young, to 8, for the case in which all of the Portuguese students are also young.\nSyllogistic reasoning is an interesting field from different points of view, that include theoretical and applied ones. From a theoretical perspective, as a logic, it is a kind of reasoning that should be analyzed and understood in order to increase our knowledge about how human beings perform common-sense reasoning in daily life. From an applied perspective, it is an interesting tool for the fields of decision making or database systems [3]. Furthermore, our approach to syllogistic reasoning can be contextualized in the Computing with Words paradigm, because we try to manage a form of common-sense reasoning preserving the natural language surface.\nOn the other hand, it is relevant to note that, from the point of view of reasoning, we usually focus on situations where quantified statements are assumed to be true and we are only concerned about what types of information can be inferred from them [4]. A different problem is the evaluation of quantified statements where the information about the fulfillment of the involved terms in a given universe is available. Models for this problem [5, 6] do not consider the topic of syllogistic reasoning.\nThe first systematic approach to syllogistic reasoning was developed in [7]. Nevertheless, this framework only deals with arguments composed by two premises and one conclusion and only handles the four classical logic quantifiers (all, none, some, not all). Therefore, expressiveness of this model is limited to simple statements that are far from the common uses of language.\nMost of approaches found in the literature try to extend syllogistic reasoning in two parallel ways:\n\u2022 by adding new quantifiers (like most, few, many, and so on) to the classical ones, considering crisp [8] and fuzzy [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] definitions. In these approaches only\n1In [2], an extension of Aristotelian syllogistics considering the problem of the distribution is proposed.\nabsolute/relative quantifiers involving two terms are handled, and many of the classical syllogistic reasoning patterns are not even considered [15]\n\u2022 by considering arguments composed by N statements and N terms but limited to the four logic quantifiers [16], therefore missing much of the actual expressive necessities of daily language and reasoning\nThese two ways have been approached in a mutually exclusive way, probably due to the fact that the first approaches come from the field of fuzzy modeling and the second ones from the field of linguistics and natural logic. To the best of our knowledge, no combination of both points of view has been made so far for providing a meaningful extension of the syllogistic patterns that at the same time involve relevant quantifiers (as those described in the linguistics field) and more than two terms in the statements. Therefore a general approach to syllogistic reasoning remains an incomplete task, since these approaches deal with syllogistics only from partial perspectives. Within this context, the main aim of this paper is to present a general formulation of syllogistic reasoning and its resolution that can be useful for all the fields aforementioned. Our formulation of syllogism is capable of managing different types of quantifiers within the Theory of Generalized Quantifiers (TGQ) (going much further than the usual absolute/relative quantifiers) and N > 2 premises in the reasoning scheme. Thus, our model can deal with more complex arguments and more wide fragments of natural language. Notwithstanding, the combination of absolute/proportional quantifiers in the same syllogism remains an open question and it is not dealt with in this paper.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we present the most relevant approaches to fuzzy syllogistic reasoning; in section 3 the general form of our proposal of syllogistic schema and its resolution are detailed; in section 4 some illustrative examples are shown. Finally, in section 5, we summarize the conclusions of the paper."}, {"heading": "2. Literature review", "text": "In [17] a relevant distinction in the analysis framework of the fuzzy syllogism is pointed out. There are two possible interpretations considering quantified statements with the basic structure \u201cQ A are B\u201d: (i) relative-frequency rules, where the terms A and B denote sets over a given universe and the quantifier Q denotes the relationship between both sets (e.g.; A few doctors are detective consulting); (ii) conditional rules, where A is the antecedent; B is the consequent and Q denotes the power of the link (\u2192) between the antecedent and the consequent (e.g.; If J. Watson is a doctor, then it is unlikely that he is a detective consulting). It is worth noting that the typical linguistic structure of this kind of rules is \u201cIf A then B [a, b]\u201d where the interval [a, b] denotes the reliability or the power of the link.\nBoth interpretations of the rules behave differently when they are applied to syllogistic reasoning (see Table 2). Interpretation (i) uses Zadeh\u2019s approach, and can be exactly used for syllogistic reasoning since the statements maintain the typical structure used in natural language. Interpretation (ii), based on support logic, is closer to the fuzzy modus ponens than the syllogistic reasoning.\nOn the other hand, syllogisms are classified into two classes [17]:\n1. Property inheritance (asymmetric syllogism): A term-set X and a term-set Z are linked via concatenation of X with a term-set Y and Y with Z:\nIn [14, 18] a different definition of syllogistic reasoning is proposed. Here, a \u201cqualified syllogism\u201d is defined as a \u201cclassical Aristotelian syllogism that has been \u2018qualified\u2019 through the use of fuzzy quantifiers, likelihood modifiers, and usuality modifiers\u201d [18]. Nevertheless, the reasoning scheme that the author proposes (see Table 3) does not satisfy the Aristotelian definition since neither PR2 nor C have the appropriate form.\nAnother approach to syllogistic reasoning in the fuzzy field was developed in [13, 19], where a fuzzy-logic formalization of intermediate quantifiers [8] and reasoning with them is presented. Within this fuzzy type theory -the higher order fuzzy logic- syntactic proofs on the validity of 105 Aristotelian syllogisms involving intermediate quantifiers are provided.\nOther relevant approach to syllogistic reasoning was proposed in [9, 20] and in [4]. Zadeh defines in [9] the fuzzy syllogism as \u201c...an inference scheme in which the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion are propositions containing fuzzy quantifiers\u201d. A typical example of Zadeh\u2019s fuzzy syllogism is shown in Table 4. The quantifier of the conclusion, Most \u2297 Most is calculated from the quantifiers in the premises by applying the Quantifier Extension Principle (QEP) [20], in this case using the fuzzy arithmetic product.\nZadeh\u2019s approach is characterized by the interpretation of fuzzy quantifiers as fuzzy numbers [20]. It is worth noting that he only deals with absolute/proportional quantifiers, being absolute quantifiers (around 25, none,. . . ) identified with absolute fuzzy numbers and proportional\nquantifiers (a few, many, most,. . . ) with proportional fuzzy numbers. Other types of quantifiers inspired in the linguistics area [5], such as comparative (there are about 3 more tall people than blond people) or exception (all except 3 students are tall) are therefore excluded. On the other hand, Zadeh defines a number of syllogistic patterns [9] where fuzzy arithmetics is applied to calculate the quantifier of the conclusion. As we said before, all Zadeh\u2019s patterns are based on the QEP. This principle is a special case of the most general entailment principle [21] and claims that if there exists a functional relation f between the conclusion and the premises of a syllogism, then a function \u03c6 is defined as an extension of f by the extension principle. Nevertheless, as pointed out in [3], the QEP shows some disadvantages. Firstly, different results can be obtained depending on how the cardinality equations are written; in consequence, ambiguity arises in the result of a syllogism2. Moreover, inference schemes are not reverse either with respect to addition or multiplication. Finally, there is an incompleteness of fuzzy quantifiers and fuzzy numbers, and, therefore, a lot of chances of getting a discontinuous result [3]. Finally, in [22, 23] it is shown how some of the classical syllogisms are not considered and cannot be adequately managed by Zadeh\u2019s approach.\nYager\u2019s approach [4] is an extension of Zadeh\u2019s one. In [4] some additional patterns maintaining a limited number of premises are included. The proposal has the same limitations of Zadeh\u2019s one.\nTo the aim of this paper, the most interesting approach is proposed by D. Dubois et al. [10, 11, 12] where quantifiers are interpreted as crisp closed intervals (more than a half = [0.5, 1], around three= [2, 4]). This approach is mostly focused to proportional quantifiers (such as most, many, some, between 25% and 34%,. . . ) and so a quantifier Q is modelled as Q := [q, q], where q, q \u2208 [0, 1]. Other types of quantifiers are considered by adapting the interval definition to each case: precise quantifiers (those whose values are precisely known and have precise bounds) like 10%, 30%, . . . and represented as a particular case of the previous one (taking q = q); and fuzzy quantifiers (those whose bounds are ill-defined and have imprecise, fuzzy bounds) like most, few,. . . represented using fuzzy sets. Regarding the reasoning procedure, three patterns [11] are proposed. Table 5 shows an example of Pattern III.\nIn this approach, the reasoning process is transformed into a calculation procedure consisting of the minimization and maximization of the quantifier in the conclusion. This quantifier can\n2For instance, in the example of Table 4, if most = 34 , the quantifier of C is ( 3 4 )2 . This functional relationship can also\nbe written as most 3 most , but in the case of fuzzy arithmetics with fuzzy numbers the equivalence between most 2 and most 3\nmost is not fulfilled.\nbe modeled as an interval or a trapezoidal function and is calculated taking the quantifiers of the premises as restrictions. The main aim is to obtain the most favourable and the most unfavourable proportion among the terms of the conclusion according to the proportions expressed in the premises. Using the results described in [10, 11], a first step for the development of a fuzzy linguistic syllogism is developed in [12], where the syllogistic patterns are totally expressed using linguistic terms. This approach avoids fuzzy arithmetics problems of Zadeh\u2019s approach but is still limited to a few reasoning patterns and many of the classical syllogistic patterns are not considered [22, 23]. Nevertheless, the interpretation of the quantifiers as intervals and the transformation of the reasoning problem into a calculation procedure establishes the basis for our proposal of a general approach to syllogistic reasoning that can manage arguments with N sentences and terms, the two types of syllogisms (property inheritance an combination of evidence) and involving new types of quantifiers inspired in the linguistics area [5], such as the aforementioned comparative or exception quantifiers."}, {"heading": "3. A general syllogistic reasoning pattern", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Formulation of quantified statements with generalized quantifiers", "text": "The TGQ [24] analyzes quantification in natural language combining the logic and the linguistics perspectives. Its key concept is the generalized quantifier, understood as a second order predicate that establishes a relationship between two classical sets. As an example, we describe in detail the case of proportional, absolute and exception quantifiers.\nConsidering the proportional interpretation of quantifier all, and denoting E as the referential universe and P(E) as the power set of E, the evaluation of the quantified statement \u201cAll Y1 are Y2\u201d for Y1,Y2 \u2208 P(E) can be modeled as:\nall : P(E) \u00d7 P(E) \u2192 {0, 1} (Y1,Y2) \u2192 All(Y1,Y2) =  0 : i f Y1 * Y21 : i f Y1 \u2286 Y2\nFor absolute quantifiers, evaluation of a statement like \u201cBetween 3 and 6 Y1 are Y2\u201d can be modelled as:\nBetween 3 and 6 : P(E) \u00d7 P(E) \u2192 {0, 1} (Y1,Y2) \u2192 Between 3 and 6(Y1,Y2) =  0 : i f |Y1 \u2229 Y2| < [3, 6]1 : i f |Y1 \u2229 Y2| \u2208 [3, 6]\nFor quantifiers of exception, let us consider the sentence \u201cAll but 3 Y1 are Y2\u201d; for Y1,Y2 \u2208 P(E). Its evaluation can be modelled as:\nAll but 3 : P(E) \u00d7 P(E) \u2192 {0, 1} (Y1,Y2) \u2192 All but 3(Y1,Y2) =  0 : i f |Y1 \u2229 Y2| , 31 : i f |Y1 \u2229 Y2| = 3\nLet P = {Ps, s = 1 . . . , S } be the set of relevant properties defined in E. For instance, P1 can denote the property \u201cto be a student\u201d and P2 \u201cto be tall\u201d. Let L1 and L2 be any boolean combination of the properties in P. So, the typical statement involved in a syllogism has the following general structure:\nQ L1 are L2 (1)\nwhere Q denotes a linguistic quantifier, L1 is the subject-term or restriction and L2 the predicateterm or scope. In this paper, we consider the following types of quantifiers:\n\u2022 Logical quantifiers (QLQ): The same classical quantifiers managed by Aristotle (all, none, some, not all).\n\u2022 Absolute Binary quantifiers (QAB): Natural numbers (N) with or without some type of modifier (around 5, more than 25,. . . ) following the general pattern \u201cQAB Y1 are Y2\u201d (e.g., \u201caround 5 students are tall\u201d).\n\u2022 Proportional Binary quantifiers (QPB): Linguistic terms (LT ) (most, almost all, few,. . . ) following the general pattern \u201cQPB Y1 are Y2\u201d (e.g. \u201cfew students are tall\u201d,. . . ).\n\u2022 Binary Quantifiers of Exception (QEB): Proportional binary quantifiers with a natural number (N\u2217) (all but 3, all but 3 or 4,. . . ) following the general pattern \u201cQEB Y1 are Y2\u201d (e.g., \u201call but 5 students are tall\u201d).\n\u2022 Absolute Comparative Binary Quantifiers (QCB\u2212ABS ): Natural numbers with modifiers of type more, less, (3 more. . . than, 4 less. . . than,. . . ) following the general pattern \u201cThere is/are QCB\u2212ABS Y1 than Y2\u201d (e.g. \u201cthere are 3 more boys than girls\u201d).\n\u2022 Proportional Comparative Binary Quantifiers (QCB\u2212PROP): Rational multiple or partitive numbers (Q\u2217) double, half,. . . following the general pattern \u201cThere is/are QCB\u2212PROP Y1 than Y2\u201d (e.g., \u201cthere are double boys than girls\u201d).\n\u2022 Similarity Quantifiers (QS ): Linguistic expressions that denotes similarity (S ) between two given sets very similar, few similar,. . . following the general pattern \u201cA and A\u2032 are very/few/. . . similar\u201d; where A denotes one of the sets of the comparison and A\u2032 denotes a set similar to A (e.g. \u201cThe audience of opera and ballet are very similar\u201d).\nTable 6 shows the definition of these quantifiers according to the TGQ."}, {"heading": "3.2. General inference schema for syllogistic reasoning", "text": "Reasoning consists of making explicit or extracting the implicit information contained in the premises. The main characteristic of deductive reasoning is to infer new information, a conclusion, from the set of statements that constitutes the premises of the argument. Syllogism, a type of deductive inference, is based on the relationship among sets and their cardinalities. Because of this, the reasoning process is directly linked with the classical distribution problem [25], i.e., how the elements of the referential fulfill the properties or terms in the statements. Thus, from this point of view, each one of the premises of the syllogism is a restriction that delimits the distribution and the conclusion is another constraint that must be compatible with the distribution described in the premises.\nAssuming this interpretation and following [11], we propose a transformation of the syllogistic reasoning problem into an equivalent optimization problem that consists of calculating the extreme quantifiers of the conclusion taking as restrictions the quantifiers of the premises. In [11], this idea is pointed out exclusively considering crisp sets, proportional quantifiers and only some reasoning patterns. However, a more general pattern is needed to support arguments\nconstituted by N premises, PRn, n = 1, . . . ,N and a conclusion, C, following the pattern in expression (2):\nPR1 : Q1 L1,1 are L1,2 PR2 : Q2 L2,1 are L2,2\n. . .

In addition, it is worth to mention that both the asymmetric and\nsymmetric syllogisms are consistent with this general definition. In order to support the general inference schema described in (2), we distinguish three steps: (i) dividing the universe of discourse into disjoint sets; (ii) defining sentences as systems of inequations; (iii) selecting the optimization method that should be applied in each case in order to resolve the reasoning process."}, {"heading": "3.2.1.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the Li, js are atomic; that is, they are not boolean combinations of sets. This assumption does not limit the the generality of the solution that can be extended by simply and directly substituting the atomic parts by the boolean combination of sets. For instance, for S = 2 we have the following combinations of disjoint sets:\nP\u20321 = L1 \u2229 L2 P\u20322 = L1 \u2229 L2 P\u20323 = L1 \u2229 L2 P\u20324 = L1 \u2229 L2\n(4)\nWhere the usual notation L1, L2 for the terms in the propositions has been used instead of the one introduced in expression 2.

For instance, solving a binary proposition such as \u201cbetween 3 and 6 Y1 are Y2\u201d, that involves the absolute binary quantifier QAB = [3, 6], is equivalent to inequations x3 \u2265 4 and x3 \u2264 6 (see (4) and (5)).

The fundamental idea of this transformation is described in [10, 11] for binary proportional quantifiers. However, our approach is more general since we also incorporate other type of quantifiers and also any boolean combination in the restriction and scope of the quantified statements.\nIn order to correctly apply the resolution method (SIMPLEX), it is necessary to add three additional constraints to the set of inequations obtained from the syllogistic argument. The first constraint guarantees that there are no sets with a negative number of elements;\nxk \u2265 0,\u2200k = 1, . . . ,K = 2S (6)\nThe other two constraints are only necessary if the quantifier of the conclusion is a proportional one.

How many animals do I have in my home, if all but two are dogs, all but two are cats and all but two are parrots?\nAs we can see, a combination of exception crisp quantifiers are involved. In order to formalize the wording according to the typical form of a syllogism, the first step is to identify the number of involved terms. In this case, for simplicity and for coherence with Fig. 1, let us consider E =animals in my home and three terms dogs = P1, cats = P2 and parrots = P3.\nTable 8 shows a first formalization of the problem considering only the explicit information of the wording.

It is necessary to incorporate additional premises with the implicit or contextual information. In this case, we had added five premises (PR4 \u2212 PR8) thus producing the extended syllogism shown in Table 9.\nThe corresponding quantifiers of the additional premises PR4 \u2212 PR8 are logical quantifiers Q4 = Q5 = Q6 = Q7 = Q8 = none, labelled as QLQ\u2212none in Table 7 (left).

Nevertheless, the wording of the problem has implicit that the only animals that can be at home are dogs, cats and parrots and for that reason they are included.\nThe example shows a relevant aspect to manage in problems expressed in natural language: contextual and implicit information must be incorporated to the syllogism.

The corresponding solutions define KERQC and S UPQC for the quantifier QC in the conclusion, respectively.

For the cases of non-trapezoidal quantifiers this produces an approximate solution. In the cases where non-normalized quantifiers may appear (either in the definition of the premises or due to the non-existence of solutions for the inequations system) this approach cannot produce results and therefore solutions should be obtained by using the approach described in section 4.3.\nFor the example in Table 10 we have Q1 = {[0.8, 0.9], [0.7, 1]}; Q2 = {[0.8, 0.85], [0.75, 0.9]}; Q3 = {[0.92, 1], [0.9, 1]}; Q4 = {[0.9, 0.95], [0.85, 1]}; and QC = {[b, c], [a, d]} the quantifier of the conclusion.\nApplying the procedure described in section 4.1 for each system, we obtain KERQC = [0.42, 1] for the system defined by taking the Kernels of all the quantifiers in the premises and S UPQC = [0.20, 1] for the the system defined by taking the Supports of all the quantifiers in the premises.

This is a way of defining proportional quantifiers (such as few, many, most,. . . ) where the linguistic term is interpreted as a fuzzy subset Q of the [0, 1] interval. Its basic definition is shown in equation 15\nQ\u03b1(p) = p\u03b1;\u03b1 > 0 (15)\nwhere Q\u03b1 denotes a linguistic quantifier and p \u2208 [0, 1]. For instance, for Q2 (labelled as most), Q2(0.95) = 1 means that saying 95% completely fulfills the meaning conveyed by most and Q2(0.6) = 0.75 means that saying 60% fulfils with degree 0.75 the meaning conveyed by most. Other usual RIM quantifiers are Q0.5, usually labelled [28] as \u201ca few\u201d and Q1 (identity quantifier, also labelled as \u201ca half\u201d). RIM quantifiers are also associated with the semantics of \u201cthe greater the proportion of . . . the better\u201d due to its increasing monotonic behaviour. Under this interpretation, the semantics should be labelled accordingly to the actual value of \u03b1 as \u201clinear\u201d (\u03b1 = 1), \u201cquadratical\u201d (\u03b1 = 2), \u201csub-linear\u201d (\u03b1 < 1), ...\nSo, let us consider the following example using RIM quantifiers: in a wine warehouse that sells red, white wine and other products derived from grapes, we have the following sentences:\nQ1 bottles of red wine are sold in the United Kingdom. Q1 bottles of red wine sold in the United Kingdom are bought by J. Moriarty.\nBoth propositions involve the identity quantifier Q1 (\u03b1 = 1), that can either be interpreted as \u201ca half\u201d or as the greater. . . the better (linear, \u03b1 = 1).\nIf we apply the Zadeh\u2019s [9] Intersection/product pattern, we can infer the following statement: \u201cQC bottles of red wine are sold in United Kingdom and bought by J. Moriarty\u201d. So, the corresponding syllogism is shown in Table 11.\nAs the result of the corresponding optimization method, we obtain the quantifier QC shown in Figure 5, such that QC = Q0.5. Its linguistic interpretations are \u201ca few\u201d [28] \u201cA few bottles of red wine sold in the United Kingdom are bought by J. Moriarty\u201d or \u201cThe greater the proportion of bottles of red wine that are sold in the United Kingdom and bought by J. Moriarty the better\u201d (sublinear, \u03b1 = 0.5).\nIn case this example was solved using the KER\u2212 S UP linear interpolation approach a much worse approximation (with bigger error) would be obtained for the inferred sublinear quantifier QC = Q0.5 in Figure 5."}, {"heading": "4.3.4.

Let us consider the account of the wine warehouse, that is not so good, and they only manage the following data:\nMany sales are from red wine. A few sales are from white wine.\nTaking both statements as premises in the universe of products sold by wine warehouse=E, we have a syllogism with three terms: sales=P1, red wine=P2 and white wine=P3. With these two premises we can use, for example, consequent disjunction pattern of Zadeh [9], which conclusion has the form \u201cQC P1 are P2 or P3\u201d being P1 the subject of the premises and P2 and P3 the corresponding predicates. However, in this example, we change the conclusion by the following one \u201cQC sales are not from red wine or white wine\u201d, because this allow them to know how many sales are from other products. Table 12 shows the complete syllogism.\nThe first step to perform in the inference process is to assign the corresponding trapezoidal function to each one of the linguistic quantifiers of the premises. Taking as inspiration [29], we assign the following trapezoids: Many = [0.5, 0.55, 0.65, 0.7] and Few = [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25]. Next, we apply the reasoning procedure obtaining the following result: QC = [0, 0, 0.45, 0.5]; that is, more or less, \u201cAt most half sales are not from red wine or white wine\u201d. In Fig. 6 we show the corresponding fuzzy set. It is relevant to note that the obtained QC of this example is a decreasing quantifier, a type of quantifier that some classical models of fuzzy syllogism cannot manage [9, 15].\nExample shown in Table 12 shares the same aspect of P. Peterson\u2019s Intermediate Syllogisms [8], but with a different conclusion because Peterson\u2019s schemas only include simple conclusions, without involving logical operations like disjunction.

Example 5 (Exception fuzzy quantifiers): wine warehouse", "text": "The last example shows a syllogism combining fuzzy quantifiers that have not been previously considered in the literature like exception quantifiers (i.e., all but around four,. . . ) combined with absolute ones (i.e., around four,. . . ):\nAll but around fifteen boxes of wine are for J. Moriarty. Around four boxes of the boxes that are not for J. Moriarty are for J. Watson.\nWe can identify the following three terms in the statements: boxes of wine= P1, boxes for J. Moriarty= P2 and boxes for J. Watson= P3. Given this information, we can infer how many boxes are not for J. Moriarty neither for J. Watson; that is, \u201cQC boxes are not for J. Moriarty neither for J. Watson\u201d. In Table 14 is afforded the complete argument.\nThe quantifier of PR1 is a fuzzy quantifier of exception, because it is indicating that there is around fifteen boxes of wine that are not for J. Moriarty. For instance, the associated trapezoidal function to this number can be around 15= [13, 14, 16, 17]. The quantifier of PR2 is another fuzzy quantifier, but in this case an absolute one. This kind of quantifiers is analyzed in the literature from the very beginning (Zadeh\u2019s distinction between absolute/proportional fuzzy quantifiers [20]), but it has not been considered from the point of view of its use in reasoning. In this case, we assign around four= [3, 4, 4, 5].\nAfter applying the reasoning process, we obtain the absolute quantifier QC = [8, 10, 12, 14] for the conclusion, with the usual associated meaning of around 11 (since value 11 is in the middle of the trapezoid\u2019s kernel). Therefore, in this example the conclusion states that \u201cAround eleven boxes are not for J. Moriarty neither for J. Watson\u201d.\nOn the other hand, it is worth noting that this model is consistent with a fuzzy arithmetic approach to this problem; since from PR1 we have that \u201caround 15\u201d boxes are not for J. Moriarty, and from PR2 we have that \u201caround four\u201d of these are not for J. Watson; therefore, \u201caround 15\u201d \u201caround 4\u201d = \u201caround 11\u201d, which is the number of boxes that are not for J. Moriarty neither for J. Watson."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "We have formulated a general approach to syllogistic reasoning that overcomes the limitation in the number of premises and is compatible with the TGQ, which allows us to manage new types of quantifiers not considered in the literature until now.

The approach also can manage\ndifferent definitions of quantifiers, both crisp and fuzzy. This model is currently implemented as a software library that is able to manage all the types of quantifiers described in the paper.\nAs a future work, we aim to extend our method for managing different types of quantifiers within the same syllogism and to include new type of quantifiers of arities greater than two (ternary and quaternary ones). Other relevant topic that can be considered is the managing and formalization of contextual or implicit information that is relevant for the syllogistic reasoning.Finally, developing a symbolic approach to syllogism generating a table of syllogisms using a determined set of quantifiers (with a definition supported on their use in natural language) is another aim."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (grant TIN200800040), the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Innovation and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER) (grant TIN2011-29827-C02-02) and the Spanish Ministry for Education (FPU Fellowship Program).
