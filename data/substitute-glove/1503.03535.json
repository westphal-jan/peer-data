Until recently, the application of neural networks to machine translation\n? Equal contribution \u2020 Work done while author was at Universite\u0301 de Montre\u0301al\nwas restricted to extend standard machine translation tools for rescoring translation hypotheses or reranking n-best lists (see, e.g., Schwenk, 2012, 2007a). The neural machine translation approach, however, showed that it is possible to build a competitive end-to-end neural network-based translation system for English-French and EnglishGerman (Sutskever et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2014) (also see Section 2).\nA large part of the recent success of neural machine translation systems for these language pairs is due to the availability of very large amounts of high quality, sentence aligned corpora. For the majority of language pairs however, this is not the case since large refined corpora are in general scarce. This can be a problem even in the case of high-resource languages (such as ChineseEnglish) where in a domain specific setting there can also be a lack of parallel corpora. In this work, we focus on such low resource language pairs and domain specific translation problems which is a common scenario in machine translation. In the case of a lack of data, applicability of neural machine translation to these low-resource translation tasks can be restricted.\nOn the other hand, monolingual data is almost always both universally available and abundant. Despite being \u201cunlabeled\u201d, monolingual corpora still exhibit rich linguistic structure that may be useful for translation tasks. This presents an opportunity to leverage large available monolingual corpora to give hints to the neural machine translation system. One way to incorporate monolingual corpora in any translation system is to integrate a language model (LM) trained on the monolingual dataset (target language) into the translation system. This approach has been traditionally used heavily in machine translation (Hoang et al., 2007) and speech recognition system (Young et al., 1996).\nIn this paper, we explore methods for integrat-\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n03 53\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 M\nar 2\n01 5\ning a language model into neural machine translation systems. In particular, we focus on two challenging, low-resource translation tasks in TurkishEnglish (Tr-En) and Chinese-English (Zh-En). Available parallel corpora for these two pairs are significantly smaller than those available for language pairs used in previous work (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014) such as English-French. For instance, the OpenMT\u201915 English-Chinese bilingual corpus (the largest dataset we used in this work) has approximately 40 times fewer examples than the commonly used subset of the WMT\u201914 English-French dataset.\nIn addition to the lack of large parallel corpora, both Tr-En and Zh-En translation tasks pose unique challenges arising from the linguistic properties of Turkish and Chinese. The morphology of Turkish, which is an agglutinative language, is richer than that of many Indo-European languages (e.g., English and French). This leads to the exploding vocabulary problem without proper segmentation (Oflazer et al., 1994). Chinese sentences, on the other hand, do not utilize blank spaces to separate words, making it difficult to build a vocabulary of word tokens which are often the unit of translation in the traditional statistical machine translation (SMT) system (Koehn, 2010). In our work, we empirically show that the neural machine translation system performs on these challenging language pairs as well as, or better than the existing SMT systems.\nIn Section 2, we review recent work in neural machine translation. We present our basic model architecture in Sec. 3 and describe our shallow and deep fusion approaches in Sec. 4. Finally, we describe our main experimental results in Sec. 6."}, {"heading": "2 Background: Neural Machine Translation", "text": "SMT systems maximize the conditional probability p(y | x) of a correct target translation y given a source sentence x. This is done by maximizing separately a language model p(y) and the (reverse) translation model p(x | y) component by using Bayes\u2019 rule:\np(y | x) \u221d p(x | y)p(y).\nThis decomposition into a language model and translation model is meant to make full use of available corpora: monolingual corpora for fitting\nthe language model and parallel corpora for the translation model. In reality, however, SMT systems tend to model log p(y | x) directly by linearly combining multiple features by using a socalled log-linear model:\nlog p(y | x) = \u2211 j fj(x,y) + C, (1)\nwhere fj is the j-th feature based on both or either of the source and target sentences, and C is a normalization constant which is often ignored. These features include, for instance, pair-wise statistics between two sentences/phrases. The log-linear model is fitted to data, in most cases, by maximizing an automatic evaluation metric other than an actual conditional probability, such as BLEU.\nNeural machine translation, on the other hand, aims at directly optimizing log p(y | x) including the feature extraction as well as the normalization constant by a single neural network. This is typically done under the encoder-decoder framework (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014) consisting of neural networks. The first network encodes the source sentence x into a continuous-space representation from which the decoder decodes the target translation sentence. By using RNN architectures equipped to learn long term dependencies such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)/Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the whole system can be trained a end-to-end fashion (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014).\nOnce the model learns the conditional distribution or translation model, given a source sentence we can find a translation that approximately maximizes the conditional probability using, for instance, a beam search algorithm."}, {"heading": "3 Model Description", "text": "We used the model proposed recently by Bahdanau et al. (2014) that learns to jointly (soft)align and translate as a baseline neural machine translation system in this paper. Here, we describe in detail this model to which we refer as \u201cNMT\u201d.\nThe encoder of the NMT is a bidirectional RNN which consists of forward and backward RNNs (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997). The forward RNN reads the input sequence/sentence x = (x1, . . . , xT ) in a forward direction, resulting in a sequence of hidden states ( \u2212\u2192 h 1, . . . , \u2212\u2192 h T ). The backward RNN reads x in an opposite direction\nand outputs ( \u2190\u2212 h 1, . . . , \u2190\u2212 h T ). We concatenate a pair of hidden states at each timestep to build a sequence of annotation vectors (h1, . . . ,hT ), where\nhj = [ \u2190\u2212 h j\u2212\u2192 h j ] .\nEach annotation vector hj encodes information about the j-th word with respect to all the other surrounding words in the sentence.\nIn our decoder, which we construct with a single layer RNN, at each time step t a soft-alignment mechanism first decides on which annotation vectors are most relevant. The relevance weight \u03b1tj of the j-th annotation vector for the t-th target word is computed by a feedforward neural network f that takes as input hj and the previous decoder\u2019s hidden state st\u22121:\netj = f(st\u22121,hj).\nThe outputs etj are normalized over the sequence of the annotation vectors so that the they sum to 1:\n\u03b1tj = exp(etj)\u2211T k=1 exp(etk) ,\nand we call \u03b1tj a relevance score, or an alignment weight, of the j-th annotation vector.\nThe relevance scores are used to get the context vector ct of the t-th word in the translation:\nct = T\u2211 j=1 \u03b1tjhj ,\nThen, the decoder\u2019s hidden state sTMt at time t is computed based on the previous hidden state sTMt\u22121, the context vector ct and the previously translated word yt\u22121:\nst = fr(sTMt\u22121,yt\u22121, ct), (2)\nwhere fr is the gated recurrent unit (Cho et al., 2014).\nWe use a deep output layer (Pascanu et al., 2014) to compute the conditional distribution over words:\np(yt|y<t,x) \u221d exp(y>t (Wofo(s TM t ,yt\u22121, ct) + bo)), (3)\nwhere yt is an one-hot encoded vector indicating one of the words in the target vocabulary. Wo is a learned weight matrix and bo is a bias. fo\nis a single-layer feedforward neural network with a 2-way maxout non-linearity (Goodfellow et al., 2013).\nThe whole model, including both the encoder and decoder, is jointly trained to maximize the (conditional) log-likelihood of the bilingual training corpus:\nmax \u03b8\n1\nN N\u2211 n=1 log p\u03b8(y (n)|x(n)),\nwhere the training corpus is a set of (x(n),y(n))\u2019s, and \u03b8 denotes a set of all the tunable parameters."}, {"heading": "4 Integrating Language Model into the Decoder", "text": "In this paper, we propose two alternatives to integrating a language model into a neural machine translation system which we refer as shallow fusion (Sec. 4.1) and deep fusion (Sec. 4.2). Without loss of generality, we use a language model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNLM, Mikolov et al., 2011) which is equivalent to the decoder described in the previous section except that it is not biased by a context vector (i.e., ct = 0 in Eqs. (2)\u2013 (3)).\nIn the sections that follow, we assume that both a NMT model (on parallel corpora) as well as a RNNLM (on larger monolingual corpora) have been pre-trained separately before being integrated. We denote the hidden state at time t of the RNNLM with sLMt ."}, {"heading": "4.1 Shallow Fusion", "text": "Shallow fusion is analogous to how language models are used in the decoder of a usual SMT system. At each time step, the translation model proposes a set of candidate words. The candidates are then scored according to the weighted sum of the scores given by the translation model and the language model.\nIn more detail, at each time step t, the translation model (in this case, the NMT) will compute the score of every possible next word for each hypothesis in a set of hypotheses { y (i) \u2264t\u22121 } . Each score is the summation of the score of the hypothesis and the score given by the NMT to the word. All these new hypotheses (a hypothesis from the previous timestep with a next word appended at the end) are then sorted according to their respec-\ntive scores, and the topK ones are selected as candidates { y\u0302 (i) \u2264t } i=1,...,K .\nWe then rescore these hypotheses with the weighted sum of the scores by the NMT and RNNLM, where we only need to recompute the score of the \u201cnew word\u201d at the end of each candidate hypothesis. The score of the new word is computed by\nlog p(yt = k) = log pTM(yt = k)\n+ \u03b2 log pLM(yt = k), (4)\nwhere \u03b2 is a hyper-parameter that needs to be tuned to maximize the translation performance on a development set.\nSee Fig. 1 (b) for illustration."}, {"heading": "4.2 Deep Fusion", "text": "In deep fusion, we integrate the RNNLM and the decoder of the NMT by concatenating their hidden states next to each other (see Fig. 1 (b)). The model is then finetuned to use the hidden states from both of these models when computing the output probability of the next word (see Eq. (3)). Unlike the vanilla NMT (without any language model component), the hidden layer of the deep output takes as input the hidden state of the RNNLM in addition to that of the NMT, the previous word and the context such that\np(yt|y<t,x) \u221d exp(y>t (Wofo(s LM t , s TM t ,yt\u22121, ct) + bo)),\n(5)\nwhere again we used the superscripts LM and TM to distinguish the hidden states of the RNNLM and NMT.\nDuring the finetuning of the model, we tune only the parameters that were used to parameterize the output (5). This is to ensure that the structure learned by the LM from monolingual corpora is not overwritten. It is possible to use monolingual corpora as well while finetuning all the parameters, but in this paper, we altered only the output parameters in the stage of finetuning."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Balance between LM and TM", "text": "Intuitively, some words in the translated sentence are decided based mostly on the source sentence (i.e., by the TM), but some other words will be mostly based on the language model (LM). For example, there are no Chinese word that corresponds\nto articles in English, and in the case of Chinese to English translation, the decoder will need to insert a correct/appropriate article based mainly on the signal from the LM. On the other hand, if a noun is to be translated, it may be better to ignore any signal from the LM, as it may prevents the decoder from choosing the correct translation.\nIn order for the decoder to flexibly balance between the signal from the LM and TM, we augment the decoder with a so-called controller. The controller is implemented as a function taking as input the hidden state of the LM and computing\ngt = \u03c3 ( v>g s LM t + bg ) , (6)\nwhere \u03c3 is a logistic sigmoid function. vg and bg are learned parameters.\nThe output of the controller is then multiplied to the hidden state of the LM. This means that we let the decoder use the signal from the TM fully, while the controller controls the magnitude of the LM signal.\nFrom our experiments, we empirically found that it is better to initialize the bias bg to a small, negative number. This allows the decoder to decide the importance of the LM only when it is deemed necessary."}, {"heading": "5 Datasets", "text": "We evaluate the proposed approaches to incorporating monolingual data in neural machine translation in two tasks: Chinese to English (Zh-En) and Turkish to English (Tr-En).

The results we reported in this paper reflect this dependency clearly.\nIn the case of Zh-En, intuitively, we can tell that the style of writing in both SMS/CHAT as well as the conversational speech will be significantly different from that of news articles (which constitutes the majority of the English Gigaword corpus). This is clearly supported by the high per-\nplexity on the development set with our LM (see the column Zh-En of Table 4). This explains the marginal improvement we observed in Sec. 7.1.\nOn the other hand, in the case of Tr-En, the similarity between the domain of the monolingual corpus and that of translation is higher (see the column Tr-En of Table 4). Accordingly, we were able to gain a significant improvement in translation performance by integrating the external language model.\nThis further hints at the importance of the controller (see Sec. 4.2.1) and explains why the proposed shallow fusion did not help, and sometimes hurt, the overall translation performance. In other words, the fusion works only if the final model has a capability of selectively using the additional LM which may well contain useless or adversarial information (according to the task at hand). The controller mechanism embedded in deep fusion implements this capability, and thus makes the model more robust to dissimilarities in the domains."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In conclusion, despite recent successes, neural machine translation (NMT) suffers from the fact that it is not able to use the vast amount of available monolingual data. The ability of incorporating monolingual corpus is especially important for the common case of low-resource language pairs, which may be the reason why the recent success of NMT has largely been for pairs of European languages (En-Fr and En-De).\nIn this paper, we proposed two alternative approaches to this problem which allow NMT models leverage monolingual data: shallow fusion and deep fusion. We empirically evaluated these approaches on two low-resource language pairs: EnZh (SMS/Chat and conversational speech) and EnTr (TED/TEDx Subtitles). We observed a significant performance improvement when the NMT model was integrated with the external language model (LM) using the proposed deep fusion. Furthermore, on both language pairs, the NMT models trained with deep fusion were able to achieve better results than the existing phrase-based statistical machine translation systems (up to +1.96 BLEU points on En-Tr).\nCareful analysis also revealed that the performance improvement from incorporating an external LM was highly dependent on the domain similarity between the monolingual corpus and the target task. This also explained why deep fusion, which implements an adaptive mechanism for modulating information from the integrated LM, works better than shallow fusion. This analysis also suggests that in the future, domain adaption of the language model may further improve the performance."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank the developers of Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010; Bastien et al., 2012).

In particular, we investigated how to leverage abundant monolingual data for these low-resource translation tasks. Without the use of external alignment tools, we obtained up to a 1.96 BLEU score improvement with our proposed method compared to the previous best result in Turkish-to-English translation on the IWLST 2014 dataset.
