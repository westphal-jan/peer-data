Those cultures are deteriorating and emptying of their meaning, their mellow content and values in many African peoples. Even the contents proposed by medias, educational systems and Internet are turned to the West side; this doesn't help African youth to know their culture. Yet, culture seems increasingly guide human activities. Some ways out seem identified : a permanent (re)education and of course internet. On the web, all topics are covered. It constitutes in that capacity, the most global source of information.\nTo refresh the memory of our citizens and to give a transparent view of opportunities (unknown infrastructures, etc.) and challenges (investments unequally distributed, etc.) through endogenous information (from involved actors), rather than external analysis, we project, the implementation of ontology-based web platform for sociocultural knowledge sharing and co-construction, in Cameroonian context. Here, sociocultural knowledge concept, concerns all forms of human knowledge: objects that compound the real world, facts and events [3].\nOntology is a organized conceptualization to produce a formal object, when relationships between concepts are semantic and formalized. It allows organizing data, improvement of information retrieval and automated indexation by introducing a semantic layer in the semantic web applications architecture. As such, ontologies are considered as knowledge representation tools transforming data into information and information into knowledge. The semantic web is an evolution of Web, through ontologies; it aims to allow software agents to understand that, the web pages content is not just a sequence of characters and pixels but intelligible information in the same way as humans.\nThe issue of this paper is to present our sociocultural knowledge ontology (OntoSOC) modeling approach. Which ontology will be used by our platform. OntoSOC modeling approach is based\ndational concept is \u201cactivity\u201d, which is understood as purposeful, transformative, and developing interaction between actors (\u201csubjects\u201d) and the world (\u201cobjects\u201d). That Sociocultural ontology will allow us to identify which type of data could be shared on our platform.\nThis paper continues with background in which we present the related works to our ontology. Then, the third part presents our modeling approach which based on the Engestr\u00f6m\u201fs Human Activity Theory; we will explain how we reuse the related ontologies to solve the interoperability issue. In part four, we present how this ontology could be used through use cases and SPARQL queries. We end with a conclusion and perspectives for this work."}, {"heading": "2 Related works", "text": "To our best knowledge only the Sociocultural Ontology [4][5] cover the sociocultural domain which has been developed in the Senegalese context. The modeling approach based on the first generation of HAT of Vygotsky. The model is organized around the \"mediation\" concept and based on the idea that, human actions are mediated by cultural, symbolic or physical artifacts that enable man to act on his environment. We agree that, the principle of authors on ontology should be more oriented on knowledge shared by communities rather than relationships between individuals. However, the translation of view done, considering the community as an atomic entity hides a set of information that we consider relevant in our context. It is the case of the internal dynamics (collaboration, interaction, actors and roles, etc.) of communities and the contextual nature (regulations, used tools, etc.) for organizing any activity. Not only, this information further enrich the knowledge base considered both as a \"collective memory\" and a standard PDIS on Cameroon but also allows conducting deep analyzes of communities and activities.\nHowever, since the socio-cultural field is multidisciplinary, we reuse some related vocabularies which are:\n- Foaf1 : FOAF (Friend Of A Friend) project is a standard vocabulary that describes in RDF relationships between people while Wai 2 is its extension , which defines roles that people can play in community. We plan to model the cultural aspects of a community that essentially consists of people that FOAF and Wai allow us to model.\n- - Schema.org3 is a collection of websites developers shared concepts in Microdatas, RDFa and JSON-LD formats to make the web pages content understandable by search engines like Google, Yahoo etc. DBpedia 4 is an academic and a community project for automatic data exploration from Wikipedia to propose a structured version in semantic web format of data. Both vocabularies cover a large part of socio-cultural aspects of locality and community that we intend to reuse in OntoSOC."}, {"heading": "3 OntoSOC Modeling", "text": "Practically, ontological engineering does not propose a standardized method or general methodology for building ontologies [6].

The universe is evolving. These changes are driven by groups of individuals through their various activities.To analyze and understand these changes and how they transform reality, many human activities models have been proposed. Among them, we have the Vygotsky\u201fs model [7] and Engestr\u00f6m\u201fs model [8]. Engestr\u00f6m defines four characteristics that allow us to model dynamism within communities and the contextual factor of each activity:\n- Human activity must be represented by its simplest expression; - Human activity must be parsed in terms of its dynamism and its historical transformation; - Human activity should be considered as a contextual phenomenon, that is to say, as an eco-\nsystem of relationships between people and their environment;\n- Human activity should be interpreted as a phenomenon mediated by culture (more than a dia-\nlectical relationship).\nTo achieve our concern which is modeling knowledge related to various activities organized daily in our localities we have chosen Engestr\u00f6m\u201fs model as formal framework basis of our modeling process."}, {"heading": "3.1 Engestr\u00f6m Human Activity Model", "text": "The Engestr\u00f6m Human Activity Theory is known as third generation model. It points out clear distinction between individual and collective activity. It\u201es produced according to the historical and cultural view of Activity. According to its author, it helps to have a holistic view of local change dynamics while considering culture and historicity [8]. The model has six poles (Subject, Object, Tool, Rules, Community and Division of Labour) as shown in Figure 1.\n\u2500 Subject : represents the individual chosen to analyze by the observer ; \u2500 Object : transformation of the environment by the activity (task to be performed, objective to\nbe achieved);\n\u2500 Tools : materials or symbolic tools that mediate the activity ; \u2500 Community : set of subjects (or subgroups) that share the same objects and differ thereby other\ncommunities;\n\u2500 Division of Labour : it considers both the horizontal distribution of actions among the subjects, community members and the vertical hierarchy or responsibilities and statutes; \u2500 Rules : they refer to standards, conventions, habits, etc. implicit and explicit that maintain and regulate the actions and interactions within the system."}, {"heading": "3.2 Fundamental concepts and Relationships identification process", "text": "The Engestr\u00f6m Theory is characterized by individual and collective vision of the activity concept and Any HAT has meaning only in a social matrix (context).

In first case, the community pole was involved in seven (07) different triads, same for the other two, and at all, twenty one (21) implications of the concept in different triads.This process permitted us to decide the existence or otherwise, and semantics of the relationships between the different poles of the model. For example, in Subject-Community-Tools and ToolsCommunity-Object triads, a triplet BelongsTo (Tools, Community) could exist. Indeed, any tool used during the activity execution does not necessarily belongs to the community that organizes it, for that purpose, we decided not to consider the possible relationship between tools and community.\nOtherwise, from Rules-Community-Object and Subject-Object-Rules triads, the overall semantics got out from used situations of rules concept have allowed to tie it to the Community by isRegulated relationship.\nFinally ; after eliminating redundant triplets, we have the following triplets: isUsedBy (Tools, Subject), isMemberOf (Subject, Community), isRegulatedBy (Community, Rules), isCreatedBy (Division of Labour, Community), plays(Subject, Division of Labour), isRealisedBy (Division of Labour, Object), isOrganisedBy(Object, Community), isLocatedIn(Community, Locality), isOccuredIn(Object, Locality), isBorderdBy (Locality, Locality).\n6 Cultural community Naakosenda was engaged in cultural event 7 CDE-SAARE was building the rural library 8 Club 2-0 organized holidays soccer tournament\npredicates represent the different relationships between them.

There are many approaches to develop hierarch of class : from top-down, bottom-up, to hybrid approach.

Personas are fictional personifications which represent realistic individual persons. In our case, we used \"collaborative persona\". The Advanced form of individual persona.

To get there, we simulated the Engestr\u00f6m Human Activity Theory to identify upperlevel ontology concepts and relationships between them. The developed ontology is considered as an improved version of ontology developed by [5], But in the Cameroonian context. To fix the interoperability problem we established mapping between OntoSOC concepts and those related.We populated our ontology with three use cases and applied some SPARQL tests. Certainly, the three cases are far to be representative, but, their data helped us to eliminate or explain some inconsistencies.\nIt should be noted that the elimination of redundant triplets was done empirically. We have no guarantee of reaching the minimal coverage. Nevertheless, the reduction rate is considerable, about 60%. In addition, the notion of sociocultural knowledge is not easy to be well-mastered: it can be specific to a problem, generally to a domain, deep; surface, accurate, uncertain, imprecise or incomplete. However, OntoSOC informs us about data type to be shared and co-constructed into our platform.\ngy modeling.
