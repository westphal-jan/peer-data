In recent years, word segmentation and POS tagging have undergone great development. The popular method is to regard these two tasks as sequence labeling problem [7, 5], which can be handled with supervised learning algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (ME) [1], averaged perceptron [2], Conditional Random Fields (CRF)[3]. After years of intensive researches, Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging achieve a quite high precision. However, their performance is not so satisfying for the practical demands to analyze Chinese texts, especially for informal texts. The key reason is that most of annotated corpora are\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n07 59\n9v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\ndrawn from news texts. Therefore, the system trained on these corpora cannot work well with the out-of-domain texts.\nIn this shared task, we focus to evaluate the performances of word segmentation and POS tagging on relatively informal micro-texts."}, {"heading": "2 Data", "text": "Different with the popular used newswire dataset, we use relatively informal texts from Sina Weibo1. The training and test data consist of micro-blogs from various topics, such as finance, sports, entertainment, and so on. Both the training and test files are UTF-8 encoded.\nThe information of dataset is shown in Table 1. The out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate is slight higher than the other benchmark datasets. For example, the OOV rate is 5.58% in the popular division [9] of the Chinese Treebank (CTB 6.0) dataset [8], while the OOV rate of our dataset is 7.25%.\nThere are total 35 POS tags in this dataset.

Each character is labeled as one of {B, M, E, S} to indicate the segmentation. {B, M, E} represent Begin, Middle, End of a multi-character segmentation respectively, and S represents a Single character segmentation.\nFor the joint word segmentation and POS tagging, the state-of-the-art method is also based on sequence learning with cross-labels, which can avoid the problem of error propagation and achieve higher performance on both subtasks[4]. Each label is the cross-product of a segmentation label and a tagging label, e.g. {B-NN, I-NN, E-NN, S-NN, ...}. The features are generated by position-based templates on character-level.\nSequence labeling is the task of assigning labels y = y1, . . . , yn to an input sequence x = x1, . . . , xn. Given a sample x, we define the feature \u03a6(x,y). Thus, we can label x with a score function,\ny\u0302 = arg max y F (w,\u03a6(x,y)), (1)\nwhere w is the parameter of function F (\u00b7). For sequence labeling, the feature can be denoted as \u03c6k(yi, yi\u22121,x, i), where i stands for the position in the sequence and k stands for the number of feature templates.\nHere, we use two popular open source toolkits for sequence labeling task as the baseline systems: FNLP2 [6] and CRF++3. Here, we use the default setting of CRF++ toolkit with the feature templates as shown in Table 4. The same feature templates are also used for FNLP."}, {"heading": "5.3 Chinese word segmentation", "text": "In word segmentation task, the best F1 performances are 95.12, 95.52 and 96.65 for closed, semi-open and open tracks respectively.

Currently, a simple system is available at http: //nlp.fudan.edu.cn/nlpcc2015. The system also gives the leaderboards for the up-to-date results under the different tasks and tracks.
