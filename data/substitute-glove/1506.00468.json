For instance, during an earthquake in Chile rumours spread through Twitter that a volcano had become active and that there was a tsunami warning in Valparaiso (Mendoza et al., 2010). Other examples, from the riots in England in 2011, were that rioters were going to attack Birmingham\u2019s children hospital and that animals had escaped from the zoo (Procter et al., 2013).\nSocial scientists (Procter et al., 2013) analysed manually a sample of tweets expressing different judgements towards rumours and categorised them manually in supporting, denying or questioning. The goal here is to carry out tweet-level judgement classification automatically, in order to assist in (near) real-time rumour monitoring by journalists and authorities (Procter et al., 2013). In addition, information about tweet-level judgements has been used as a first step for early rumour detection by (Zhao et al., 2015).\nThe focus here is on tweet-level judgement classification on unseen rumours, based on a training\nset of other already annotated rumours. Previous work on this problem either considered unrealistic settings ignoring temporal ordering and rumour identities (Qazvinian et al., 2011) or proposed regular expressions as a solution (Zhao et al., 2015). We expect posts expressing similar opinions to exhibit many similar characteristics across different rumours. Based on the assumption of a common underlying linguistic signal, we build a transfer learning system that labels newly emerging rumours for which we have little or no annotated data. Results demonstrate that Gaussian Processbased multi task learning allows for significantly improved performance.\nThe novel contributions of this paper are: 1. Formulating the problem of classifying judgements of rumours in both supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation settings. 2. Showing how a multi-task learning approach outperforms singletask methods."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "In the context of rumour spread in social media, researchers have studied differences in infor-\nmation flows between content of varying credibility. For instance, Procter et al. (2013) grouped source tweets and re-tweets into information flows (Lotan et al., 2011), then ranked these by flow size, as a proxy of significance. Information flows were then categorised manually. Along similar vein, Mendoza et al. (2010) found that users deal with true and false rumours differently: the former are affirmed more than 90% of the time, whereas the latter are challenged (questioned or denied) 50% of the time. Friggeri et al. (2014) analyzed a set rumours from the Snopes.com website that have been matched to Facebook public conversations. They concluded that false rumours are more likely to receive a comment with link to Snopes.com website. However, none of the above attempted to automatically classify rumours.\nWith respect to automatic methods for detecting misinformation and disinformation in social media, Ratkiewicz et al. (2011) detect political abuse (a kind of disinformation) spread through Twitter. The task is defined in purely information diffusion settings and is not necessarily related with the truthfulness of the piece of information. Castillo et al. (2013) proposed methods for identifying newsworthy information cascades on Twitter and then classifying these cascades as credible and not credible. The main difference from our task is that credibility classification is carried out over the entire information cascade, classified objects are not necessarily rumours and no explicit judgement classification was performed in their approach.\nEarly rumour identification is the focus of Zhao et al. (2015), where regular expressions are used for finding questioning and denying tweets as a key pre-requisite step for rumour detection. Unfortunately, when we applied these regular expressions on our dataset, they yielded only 16% recall for questioning and 14% recall for denying tweets. Consequently, this motivated us to seek a better approach to tweet-level classification.\nThe work most relevant to ours is due to Qazvinian et al. (2011). Their method first carries out rumour retrieval, whereby tweets are classified into rumour related and non-rumour related. Next, rumour-related tweets are classified into supporting and not-supporting. The classifier is trained by ignoring rumour identities, i.e., pooling together tweets from all rumours, and ignoring the temporal dependencies between tweets. In contrast, we formulate the rumour classifica-\ntion problem as transfer learning, where unseen rumours (or rumours with few initial tweets observed) are classified using already known rumours \u2013 a much harder and more practical setting. Moreover, unlike Qazvinian et al. (2011), we consider the multi-class classification problem and do not collaps questioning and denying tweets into a single class, since they differ significantly."}, {"heading": "3 Data", "text": "We evaluate our work on several rumours circulating on Twitter during the England riots in 2011 (see Table 2). The dataset was analysed and annotated manually as supporting, questioning, or denying a rumour, by a team of social scientists studying the role of social media during the riots (Procter et al., 2013). The original dataset also included commenting tweets, but these have been removed from our experiments due to their small number (they constituted only 5% of the corpus).\nAs can be seen from the dataset overview in Table 2, different rumours exhibit varying proportions of supporting, denying and questioning tweets, which was also observed in other studies of rumours (Mendoza et al., 2010; Qazvinian et al., 2011). These variations in majority classes across rumours underscores the modeling challenge in tweet-level classification of rumour attitudes.\nWith respect to veracity, one rumour has been confirmed as true (Miss Selfridge\u2019s being on fire), one is unsubstantiated (police beat girl), and the remaining five are known to be false. Note, however, that the focus here is not on classifying truthfulness, but instead on identifying the attitude expressed in each tweet towards the rumour."}, {"heading": "4 Problem formulation", "text": "Let R be a set of rumours, each of which consists of tweets discussing it, \u2200r\u2208R Tr = {tr1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t r rn }. T = \u222ar\u2208RTr is the complete set of tweets from all rumours. Each tweet is classified as supporting, denying or questioning with respect to its rumour: y(t) \u2208 {0, 1, 2}, where 0 denotes supporting, 1 means denying and 2 denotes questioning.\nFirst, we consider the Leave One Out (LOO) setting, which means that for each rumour r \u2208 R, we construct the test set equal to Tr and the training set equal to T \\ Tr. Therefore this is a very challenging and realistic scenario, where the test set contains an entirely unseen rumour, from those in the training set.\nThe second setting is Leave Part Out (LPO). In this formulation, a very small number of initial tweets from the target rumour is added to the training set {tr\n1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , trrk}. This scenario becomes\napplicable typically soon after a rumour breaks out and journalists have started monitoring and analysing the related tweet stream. The experiments section investigates how the number of initial training tweets influences classification performance on a fixed test set, namely: {trrl , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t r rn }, l > k. The tweet-level classification problem here assumes that tweets from the training set are already labelled with the rumour discussed and the attitude expressed towards that. This information can be acquired either via manual annotation as part of expert analysis, as is the case with our dataset, or automatically, e.g. using pattern-based rumour detection (Zhao et al., 2015). Afterwards, our method can be used to classify the attitudes expressed in each new tweet from outside the training set."}, {"heading": "5 Gaussian Processes for Classification", "text": "Gaussian Processes are a Bayesian non-parametric machine learning framework that has been shown to work well for a range of NLP problems, often beating other state-of-the-art methods (Cohn and Specia, 2013; Lampos et al., 2014; Beck et al., 2014; Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015). We use Gaussian Processes as this probabilistic kernelised framework avoids the need for expensive cross-validation for hyperparameter selection.1\n1There exist frequentist kernel methods, like SVMs, which additionally require extensive heldout parameter tun-\nThe central concept of Gaussian Process Classification (GPC; (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005)) is a latent function f over inputs x: f(x) \u223c GP(m(x), k(x,x\u2032)), where m is the mean function, assumed to be 0 and k is the kernel function, specifying the degree to which the outputs covary as a function of the inputs. We use a linear kernel, k(x,x\u2032) = \u03c32x\u22a4x\u2032. The latent function is then mapped by the probit function \u03a6(f) into the range [0, 1], such that the resulting value can be interpreted as p(y = 1|x).\nThe GPC posterior is calculated as\np(f\u2217|X,y,x\u2217) = \u222b p(f\u2217|X,x\u2217, f) p(y|f)p(f)\np(y|X) df ,\nwhere p(y|f) = n\u220f\nj=1\n\u03a6(fj) yj (1\u2212\u03a6(fj)) 1\u2212yj is the\nBernoulli likelihood of class y. After calculating the above posterior from the training data, this is used in prediction, i.e.,\np(y\u2217=1|X,y,x\u2217)= \u222b \u03a6 (f\u2217) p (f\u2217|X,y,x\u2217) df\u2217 .\nThe above integrals are intractable and approximation techniques are required to solve them. There exist various methods to deal with calculating the posterior; here we use Expectation Propagation (EP; (Minka and Lafferty, 2002)). In EP, the posterior is approximated by a fully factorised distribution, where each component is assumed to be an unnormalised Gaussian.\nIn order to conduct multi-class classification, we perform a one-vs-all classification for each label and then assign the one with the highest likelihood, amongst the three (supporting, denying, questioning). We choose this method due to interpretability of results, similar to recent work on occupational class classification (Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015).\nIntrinsic Coregionalization Model In the LPO setting initial labelled tweets from the target rumour are observed as well. In this case, we propose to weight the importance of tweets from the reference rumours depending on how similar their characteristics are to the tweets from the target rumour available for training. To handle this with GPC, we use a multiple output model based on the Intrinsic Coregionalisation Model (ICM; (A\u0301lvarez et al., 2012)). It has already been applied successfully to NLP regression problems\ning.\n(Beck et al., 2014) and it can also be applied to classification ones. ICM parametrizes the kernel by a matrix which represents the extent of covariance between pairs of tasks. The complete kernel takes form of\nk((x, d), (x\u2032, d\u2032)) = kdata(x,x \u2032)Bd,d\u2032 ,\nwhere B is a square coregionalization matrix, d and d\u2032 denote the tasks of the two inputs and kdata is a kernel for comparing inputs x and x\u2032 (here, linear). We parametrize the coregionalization matrix B = \u03baI + vvT , where v specifies the correlation between tasks and the vector \u03ba controls extent of task independence.\nHyperparameter selection We tune hyperparameters v, \u03ba and \u03c32 by maximizing evidence of the model p(y|X), thus having no need for a validation set.\nMethods We consider GPs in three different settings, varying in what data the model is trained on and what kernel it uses. The first setting (denoted GP) considers only target rumour data for training. The second (GPPooled) additionally considers tweets from reference rumours (i.e. other than the target rumour). The third setting is GPICM, where an ICM kernel is used to weight influence from tweets from reference rumours."}, {"heading": "6 Features", "text": "We conducted a series of preprocessing steps in order to address data sparsity. All words were lowercased; stopwords removed; all emoticons were replaced with words2; and stemming was performed. In addition, multiple occurrences of a character were replaced with a double occurrence (Agarwal et al., 2011), to correct for misspellings and lengthenings, e.g., looool. All punctuation was also removed, except for ., ! and ?, which we hypothesize to be important for expressing emotion. Lastly, usernames were removed as they tend to be rumour-specific, i.e., very few users comment on more than one rumour.\nAfter preprocessing the text data, we use either the resulting bag of words (BOW) feature representation or replace all words with their Brown cluster ids (Brown), using 1000 clusters acquired from a large scale Twitter corpus\n2We used the dictionary from: http://bit.ly/1rX1Hdk and extended it with: :o, : |, =/, :s, :S, :p.\n(Owoputi et al., 2013). In all cases, simple retweets are removed from the training set to prevent bias (Llewellyn et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "7 Experiments and Discussion", "text": "Table 3 shows the mean accuracy in the LOO scenario following the GPPooled method, which pools all reference rumours together ignoring their task identities. ICM can not use correlations to target rumour in this case and so can not be used. The majority baseline simply assigns the most frequent class from the training set.\nWe can observe that methods perform on a level similar to majority vote, outperforming it only slightly. This indicates how difficult the LOO task is, when no annotated target rumour tweets are available.\nFigure 1 shows accuracy for a range of methods as the number of tweets about the target rumour used for training increases. Most notably, performance increases from 70% to around 80%, after only 10 annotated tweets from the target rumour become available, as compared to the results on unseen rumours from Table 3. However, as the amount of target rumour increases, performance does not increase further, which suggests that even only 10 human-annotated tweets are enough to achieve significant performance benefits. Note also how the use of reference rumours is very important, as methods using only the target rumour obtain accuracy similar to the Majority vote classifier (GP Brown and GP BOW).\nThe top performing methods are GPCIM and GPPooled, where use of Brown clusters consistently improves results for both methods over BOW, irrespective of the number of tweets about the target rumour annotated for training. Moreover, GPICM is better than GPPooled both with Brown and BOW features and GPCIM with Brown is ultimately the best performing of all.\nIn order to analyse the importance of Brown clusters, Automatic Relevance Determination\nsupporting denying questioning\n? fake ? 10001101 11111000001 10001101\n! not ! 10001100 001000 10001100\nnot ? hope 001000 10001101 01000111110\nfake ! true 11111000001 10001100 111110010110\ntrue bullshit searching 111110010110 11110101011111 01111000010\nTable 4: Top 5 Brown clusters, each shown with a representative word.

Only the case where the first 10 tweets are used for training is considered, since it already performs very well. Using ARD, we learn a separate length-scale for each feature, thus establishing their importance. The weights learnt for different clusters are averaged over the 7 rumours and the top 5 Brown clusters for each label are shown in Table 4. We can see that clusters around the words fake and bullshit turn out to be important for the denying class, and true for both supporting and questioning classes. This reinforces our hypothesis that common linguistic cues can be found across multiple rumours. Note how punctuation proves important as well, since clusters ? and ! are also very prominent."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "This paper investigated the problem of classifying judgements expressed in tweets about rumours. First, we considered a setting where no training data from target rumour is available (LOO). Without access to annotated examples of the target rumour the learning problem becomes very difficult. We showed that in the supervised domain adaptation setting (LPO) even annotating a small number of tweets helps to achieve better results. Moreover, we demonstrated the benefits of a multi task learning approach, as well as that Brown cluster features are more useful for the task than simple bag of words.\nJudgement estimation is undoubtedly of great\nvalue e.g. for marketing, politics and journalism,\nhelping to target widely believed topics. Although\nthe focus here is on classifying community reac-\ntions, Castillo et al. (2013) showed that community reaction is correlated with actual rumour veracity. Consequently our classification methods may prove useful in the broader and more challenging task of annotating veracity.\nAn interesting direction for future work would be adding non-textual features. For example, the rumour diffusion pattern (Lukasik et al., 2015) may be a useful cue for judgement classification."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Work partially supported by the European Union under grant agreement No. 611233 PHEME.
