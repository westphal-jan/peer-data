Meanwhile, feed-forward neural network is a traditional classifier, which is very hot at present with a deeper architecture. However, the training algorithm of feed-forward neural network is developed and generated from Widrow-Hoff Principle that means to minimize the squared error. In this paper, we propose a new training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks based on Margin-Based Principle, which could effectively promote the accuracy and generalization ability of neural network classifiers with less labelled samples and flexible network. We have conducted experiments on four UCI open datasets and achieved good results as expected. In conclusion, our model could handle more sparse labelled and more high-dimension dataset in a high accuracy while modification from old ANN method to our method is easy and almost free of work.\nKeywords\u2014Max-Margin Principle, Feed-Forward Neural Network, Classifier\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNEURAL network, especially feed-forward backpropagation neural network (BPNN), has been a classical classifier. Recently deep architecture of neural network is hot for both application and theory. However, the training algorithm of feed-forward neural network, no matter the shadow or the deep, is according to the Widrow-Hoff Principle which means to minimize the squared error with some weight regulation items. This kind of learning algorithms need lots of labelled samples and are tend to be overfitting. The generalization ability of these neural networks is limited by the Widrow-Hoff Principle and least square error optimization procession, so we would like to employ the Margin-Based Principle instead of Widrow-Hoff Principle to obtain a better generalization ability, which is the motivation of our novel model.\nMargin-Based Principle is proposed by Vapnik, it could deal with few labelled samples and would become sparse learning structure. The perceptron that could be treated as linear classifier, shares the disadvantages of neural network, since it also needs lots of labelled data and is tend to be overfitting. But when the Max-Margin Principle is applied to perceptron or linear classifier, SVM is born to overcome the disadvantages of\nXiao is with the State Key Lab. of Intelligent Technology and Systems, National Lab. for Information Science and Technology, Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China (e-mail:xiaoh12@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn)\nZhu is with the State Key Lab. of Intelligent Technology and Systems, National Lab. for Information Science and Technology, Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China (e-mail:zxy-dcs@tsinghua.edu.cn)\nWidrow-Hoff Principle, thus SVM could tolerate less labelled data and gain a better generalization ability. We are inspired by above facts, hence we have applied the Margin-Based Principle to the neural network training process and a novel learning model is proposed that can abandon part defects of traditional feed-forward neural networks.\nIn this paper, we treat feed-forward neural network as a two-step process, the process of input layer to hidden layers could be treated as feature abstraction and the process of hidden layers to output layer could be treated as classification. In the feature abstraction process, feed-forward neural network makes use of linear regression learners to abstract the samples to a new feature space, so we apply Min-Margin Principle to this process to minimize the error of regression or we say the error of abstraction for improving the ability of feature abstraction. While in the classification process, feed-forward neural network makes use of linear classifiers to discriminate, so we apply Max-Margin Principle to this process to minimize the structural risk. Above, we combine the two processes to an optimization problem which is our model.\nOur experiments are conducted on four UCI open datasets, which are Banknote Authentication, MAGIC Gamma Telescope, ISOLET and FarmAD. They cover many domains. The results of the experiments prove our novel training algorithm is better than traditional one that ANN, and we can draw a conclusion that Margin-Based Neural Network could achieve better accuracy with less labelled data while modification of program from traditional ANN to our method is almost free of work. Noted that going to deep is also a principle to improve feed-forward neural networks, but it focuses on the refinement of network structures, and we focus on the principle to train the neural network. Our principle could benefit both the shadow and deep model.\nAs to the application of our model, both the big labelled dataset and the relatively little labelled dataset could totally benefit from our model. Even in the big data time, labelling is also a hard process that costs much. The area such as recommendation system, log analysis in long-tailed retrieval system, medicine and other subjects remote from computer science , also suffer from the problem that little labelled data and huge predicting data. Our method could use less labelled data to achieve better accuracy, for this point, above area could be promoted. Besides, our model could replace ANN method almost without much work in practical programming.\nThe main contribution of this paper includes: 1) We proposed a novel training principle\nfor feed-forward neural networks, based on Margin-Based Principle.\n2) An training algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem, and it is a novel training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks.\nIn section II, we review the related work. In section III, we explore two processes in feed-forward neural network and how Margin-Based Principle could be applied into the two processes. In section IV, we propose our novel method and solution for optimization targets. Experiments are followed and the final section is the conclusion."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "Neural network is one of early artificial intelligence models, and now becomes a large branch of learning algorithms. What\u2019s this paper focus about is the most famous one that feed-forward back prorogation classification networks with non-linear mapping. There are three kinds of most popular ways to promote feed-forward neural network, which are to add weight regularity item to the optimization target, to prune the surplus links and to go into deep architectures. The first way is to refine the weights of the neural network and the other ways are to revise the structure of it. [1] had studied the effect of weight decay and states that it has two effects, suppressing any irrelevant of the weights and improving the generalization ability. [2] had studied the pruning of RBF Neural Network, which firstly introduces the concept of significance of the hidden neurons and then uses it in the learning algorithm to realize parsimonious networks.\nRecently such stated in [3], going to deep catches many eyes, since not only just adding the hidden layers could gain an improvement in performance, but deep neural networks can also automatically select features and amazingly complete the comprehension missions. [4] had applied deep network into natural languages, and many works such as [5] had applied deep network into image processing, deep learning is one of the hottest topic in today\u2019s AI. Before [6] and [7] proposed the fast unsupervised or supervised methods, multi-layer neural networks are hard to train, this kind of difficulty is analysed in [8] and [9], for the reason that the optimization process is often stuck into the local optima. The work in this paper is a contribution independent from deep learning, or we say, our work is a kind of principle, which could both work for shadow or deep architecture of feed-forward neural networks. As to the difficult of multilayer training algorithms which is applied with our principle, it could also be solved by the same kind of deep learning tricks, introduced by above works. In a word, deep learning is a kind of contribution to the architecture of neural networks and this paper is a kind of contribution to the training principle. Deep architecture and our principle could joint to generate a new powerful model that should be more competent than these two methods alone.\nThe famous Margin-Based model is Support Vector Machine (SVM) proposed by Vapnik and SVM could have many advantages such as small sample learning and sparse learning structures. However, Margin-Based Principle could be applied to many models to achieve the similar benefits of SVM. [10] had applied the Max-Margin Principle into the Markov Networks, and [11] had applied the Max-Margin\nFig. 1. Two Processes in Two Layers Feed-Forward Neural Networks\nPrinciple into classification of data with absent features. Both of these two works belong to supervised learning. [12] had applied Margin-Based Principle into feature selection and [13] had applied Max-Margin Principle into Clustering. Both of these two works belong to unsupervised learning. Recently, [14] had introduced this principle to on-line learning for Markov Logic Networks, and [15] had introduced it to early event detection.\nAs above, Margin-Based Principle can also be applied into feed-forward neural networks, which is one of the contributions of this paper. Our work could be applied into neural networks together with weight decay, link pruning and deep architectures. Besides our work can be used in practical usage by directly replacing ANN almost without work."}, {"heading": "III. TWO PROCESSES IN FEED-FORWARD NEURAL NETWORKS", "text": "The feed-forward neural network could be treated as two processes,that abstraction process and classification process. Take two-layers feed-forward neural network as example, as Fig. 1 illustrates.\nThe process of input layer to hidden layers corresponds to abstraction process. In this stage, each hidden neuron is treated as a linear regression learner to fit some parts of the data, and hidden neurons deal the regression results with non-linear function to get its output. In this process, the features of the samples could be converted into new space, where the hidden neurons play a role as the basis. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the hidden neuron H1 catches the characteristic of the black samples, and the hidden neuron H2 catches the characteristic of the white samples, and other hidden neuron like Hn catches some aspect of samples. All of them could abstract the original space and data distribution into an abstraction space where data manifold could be analysed easily.\nThe process of hidden layers to output layer corresponds to classification process. In this stage, each output neuron is treated as a linear classifier to discriminate different classes of data, and output neurons also deal the classification result with non-linear functions to get its output. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the output neuron O1 is a hyper-plane to separate the abstracted white samples and abstracted black samples.\nIn deeper architecture, each layer could play a role as abstraction process or classification process. And next, we will discuss about how to train different layers as different roles."}, {"heading": "A. Abstraction Process And Min-Margin Principle", "text": "As above stated, the abstraction process makes use of linear regression learners to catch different characteristics of samples. In the traditional way, the process is optimized by least square errors, as followed:\nmin J = (< ~w, ~x > \u2212y)2\nHowever, Margin-Based Principle minimizes the margin not the distance, so Min-Margin Principle takes the minimum\nFig. 2.

Least square error would be tend to be effected by coordinate geometry, for different coordinate system that may be a rotated one would give out a different regression linear hyper-plane. However, the Min-Margin Principle is geometric invariant and more essential, as one of the reasons why the abstraction process would be promoted."}, {"heading": "B. Classification Process And Max-Margin Principle", "text": "As above stated, the classification process should make use of linear classifiers to discriminate different classes, In traditional way, the linear hyper-plane could stop at any suitable position and for this reason, the network would be quickly stuck into overfitting problem.

MARGIN-BASED PRINCIPLE FOR FEED-FORWARD NEURAL NETWORKS", "text": "The input layer to hidden layers is the abstraction process where we should apply the Min-Margin Principle, and the hidden layers to output layer is the classification process where we should apply Max-Margin Principle. It means that all the hidden layers should be an abstraction process where Min-Margin Principle works and the last layer that corresponds to the output should be a classification process where Max-Margin Principle is applied into.\nThe feed-forward neural network has M hidden layers each of which has MH hidden neurons and N output neurons, the number of labelled samples is T . So we combine the two principles in one optimization problem, as maximizing\nfollowed formulations:\nObjective = \u2211T t=1{ \u2211N i=1 <~wouti ,~y M+1>ti |~wout\ni |\n\u2212 (1)\n\u03bb \u2211M\nm=1 \u2211MH j=1 <~wmj ,~y m>y m+1 j\n|~wm j | }\nIn above formula, the ~wouti is the weight vector from last hidden layer to the i-th neuron in output layer, and the ~wmi is the weight vector from (m\u2212 1)-th hidden layer to the i-th neuron in m-th hidden layer. ti is the output of i-th neuron in output layer, and ymj is the output of j-th neuron in m-th hidden layer. ~xt is the input vector, and ~ym is the output vector of (m \u2212 1)-th hidden layer. ~ym is composed by ymj . \u03bb is an hyper-parameter in the training algorithm. We noted the above formula as J .\nThe first item in above formula corresponds to the Max-Margin Principle for classification process, and the second item corresponds to the Min-Margin Principle for abstraction process.\nWhat we modified is the training algorithm comparing to ANN, and the inference algorithm is as same as traditional feed-forward neural network.\nym+1j = \u03c3(< ~w m j , ~y m >)\nAnd for brief notation, we have ~y1 = ~x , ~yM+2 = ~t and ~wout = ~wM+1. ym means the vector of outputs of (m \u2212 1)-hidden layer, it is composed by ymj .\nHowever, the output of non-linear function must be a symmetric expression for both maximum positive value and minimum negative value, so we define it and its derivative as below:\n\u03c3(x) = 11+exp(\u2212x) \u2212 0.5 (2)\n\u03c3\u2032(x) = (0.5 + \u03c3(x))(0.5 \u2212 \u03c3(x)) (3)\nThe training algorithm adopts gradient ascent for the optimization target as followed:\nJt = N\u2211\ni=1\n< ~wouti , ~y M+1 > ti\n|~wouti | \u2212 \u03bb\nM\u2211\nm=1\nMH\u2211\nj=1\n< ~wmj , ~y m > ym+1j\n|~wmj |\nGradient ascent algorithm is used, so we should work out the partial derivative of the target.

So, the training algorithm is achieved. This method in some special case may be stuck into local optima. This is the common problem for neural networks.\nThe temporal complexity for this algorithm to train one sample is O(|NodeNumber|2|LayerNumber|2). For the reason that the |LayerNumber| is fixed and small, our algorithm is as fast as traditional ones.\nTraditional feed-forward neural network would have a problem that is the saturation of this sigmoid function, and for this reason, the training is hardly possible in high-dimension dataset. However, in this optimization of our model, this problem is solved, by our part gradient items that do not involve the derivative of sigmoid function. So our model could solve high-dimension problems directly and naturally while traditional one must use other technical. This is one of advantages of our model."}, {"heading": "V.

Meanwhile, feed-forward neural network is a traditional classifier, which is very hot at present with a deeper architecture. However, the training algorithm of feed-forward neural network is developed and generated from Widrow-Hoff Principle that means to minimize the squared error. In this paper, we propose a new training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks based on Margin-Based Principle, which could effectively promote the accuracy and generalization ability of neural network classifiers with less labelled samples and flexible network. We have conducted experiments on four UCI open datasets and achieved good results as expected. In conclusion, our model could handle more sparse labelled and more high-dimension dataset in a high accuracy while modification from old ANN method to our method is easy and almost free of work.
