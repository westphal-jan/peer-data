INTRODUCTION", "text": "Even though literary style is mainly associated with creative writing and deviations from stereotypes, some literary critics have argued that clich\u00e9s can be used in literary texts for stylistic effects (Amossy & Herschberg-Perrot, 1997). Riffaterre (1964), for example, states that a clich\u00e9 can either constitute a feature of the author's style that reinforces the literary status of the text or can serve to highlight the moral as well as social behaviours of a certain group of people. According to Abrams (1999), a clich\u00e9 can be defined as \u201can expression that deviates enough from ordinary usage to call attention to itself and has been used so often that it is felt to be hackneyed or cloying\u201d. Elements of this definition can clearly be perceived in the definition Abrams (1999) gives of the trope: a figure \u201cin which words or phrases are used in a way that effects a\nconspicuous change in what we take to be their standard meaning\u201d. In this respect, it can be said that clich\u00e9s specifically refer to word combinations that started out as being creative, but, due to their popularity and the passing of time, became phraseological units. Such word combinations include, among others, dead metaphors and clich\u00e9 similes, which have been vastly studied in phraseology (Wikberg, 2008). Similes such as (1) \u201cNos actions sont comme des bouts-rim\u00e9s que chacun tourne comme il lui pla\u00eet\u201d and its translation (2) \u201cOur\u00a0actions\u00a0are \u00a0 like \u00a0the \u00a0 termination\u00a0of verses,\u00a0which\u00a0we\u00a0rhyme\u00a0as\u00a0we\u00a0please\u201d are figures of speech which rely on a linguistic marker to draw a parallel between some explicit or implicit properties that at least two semantically unrelated entities have in common. Since they generally follow the same structure as comparative statements and add concreteness to an utterance by introducing common knowledge, they constitute an inherent part of everyday language. In literary works, similes actively participate in rendering depictions and portrayals real, resonant or even surprising. Moreover, they are flexible enough to be effectively combined with other rhetorical figures such as metaphor, irony, hyperbole or alliteration (Shabat Bethlehem, 1996). Furthermore, as can be seen from the examples (1) and (2), they often have identical patterns in different languages. The present study attempts to take advantage of the semantic and syntactic similarities of those two languages as far as their simile constructions are concerned in order to, first, extract and mine similes in a corpus of French and British novels written between the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, then determine whether each simile is clich\u00e9 or not. In addition, it seeks to find out which relevant elements can be used to describe these similes from a corpus-based point of view. In its first section, this paper reviews the rhetorical structure of the similes and computational approaches proposed to identify similes and to account for their creativity. The second section describes the method used to extract as well as identify clich\u00e9 similes in the selected novels. The third section presents the corpus of novels and discusses the results obtained."}, {"heading": "2. COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO SIMILE IDENTIFICATION", "text": "In rhetoric, a simile such as (3) \u201cThis girl is graceful like a lily\u201d is made up of the following components:\n- a tenor or object of comparison; - a tertium comparationis or ground: the adjective or verb which denotes the\nproperty shared by the compared entities; - a marker; - a vehicle which refers to the term that establishes the reference against which the tenor is evaluated (Fishelov, 1993). In addition to these components, Hanks (2012) also distinguishes the eventuality, the main verb on which the simile is built.\nAs far as French is concerned, the comparative clause with a verb and an adjective ellipsis of the form \u201cA est B comme C\u201d is generally considered the prototypical form of the simile and has been extensively discussed in rhetoric in relation to the metaphor (Cohen, 1968). If \u2018comme\u2019 is undoubtedly the most frequently used simile marker in French, Shabat Bethlehem (1996) observes that be it in English dictionaries or in research articles, \u2018like\u2019 and \u2018as\u2019 are generally presented as the main or the only simile markers of the English language. This reductionist view of the simile could explain why computational approaches to simile identification has been centred on a rather small number of markers (\u2018like\u2019, \u2018as\u2019, \u2018as ... as\u2019, \u2018more \u2026 than\u2019, \u2018less \u2026 than\u2019). Automatic simile detection per se can be divided into partial and full simile detection. Partial simile detection has mainly concerned with retrieving specific simile patterns (Veale & Hao, 2007; Veale, Hao & Li, 2008; Wikberg, 2008). It consists either in looking for all corresponding patterns in a corpus or in restricting the search to preselected grounds and vehicles. Moreover, it relies on heuristics or human judgment to differentiate similes from literal comparisons. In contrast, full simile detection extracts and analyses all sentences containing a simile marker in unrestricted text, identifies the different components of the simile and separates literal similes from figurative ones. As there exists a correlation in comparative statements between the syntactic function of a word and its semantic role, Niculae (2013) uses dependency parsing to extract and to identify the components of English similes with \u2018like\u2019. He also proposes a method to recognise creative similes by measuring the semantic distance between the tenor and the vehicle using distributional semantics. The approach suggested, however, only concerns similes that have both a nominal tenor and a nominal vehicle and require both nouns to be present in the corpus used to retrieve distributional statistics. In addition, it does not take into account certain syntactic structures such as juxtaposed and coordinated verbs."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "The present study is restricted to nominal similes of the form adjectival ground + simile marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. cunning as a fox) and eventuality + simile marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. cry like a baby). Since similitude or dissimilitude are primarily inferred by meaning, unlike previous works on clich\u00e9 similes (Bolshakov, 2003), not only traditional markers, but also other markers which can be combined with these two predefined simile patterns were included. Table 1 lists all selected markers as well as their corresponding simile structures. The proposed approach to the detection of frozen similes in literary texts can be divided into two main parts:\n- extracting and mining of similes, comparisons and pseudo-comparisons; - filtering all the extracted elements based on their idiomaticity and the semantic\ndistance between the vehicle and the tenor."}, {"heading": "3.1. The simile extraction and mining module", "text": "The different steps detailed in this section are derived from the rule-based algorithm for simile mining presented in Mpouli and Ganascia (2015). The extraction and mining phase comprises various preprocessing tasks, simile candidate sentence extraction and finally, the identification of the components of each extracted simile candidate. Preprocessing tasks include tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic chunking and sentence segmentation. The first three tasks are performed with TreeTagger (Schmid 1994), a freely available multilingual tokeniser, part-of-speech tagger and chunker1. The sentence boundaries defined by TreeTagger constitute the first basis for sentence segmentation and are corrected with specific rules when an ellipsis, a question or an exclamation mark are not followed by a capital letter.\nFigure 2. Example of a chunked sentence\nSyntactic chunking is an intermediary stage between part-of-speech tagging and constituency or dependency parsing and produce \u201cflat, non-overlapping segments of a sentence that constitute the basic non-recursive phrases corresponding to the major parts-of-speech found in most wide-coverage grammars\u201d (Jurafsky & Martin, 2009). These chunks combined with handcrafted rules are essential for the two next phases. Since chunks do not give information about the grammatical function of a word, the algorithm mainly relies on syntax, dependency grammar and syntactic clues. For example, based on the syntactic order prevalent in English and in French, it can be deduced that the vehicle would be the head noun of the noun phrase that follows the 1 http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/\nmarker either directly or after an appositive phrase. In addition, the algorithm takes into consideration the ambiguity inherent to some comparative constructions and, depending on the sentence structure, labels all words that can plausibly be a component of the simile. Consequently, in a sentence such as \u201c[...] a spark was kindled that wanted but opportunity to blaze into a flame, pure and bright as the shrine on which it burned\u201d, the sentence is analysed as follows:\n- marker: \u2018as\u2019 - vehicle: \u2018shrine\u2019 - grounds: \u2018pure\u2019, \u2018bright\u2019 \u2192 tenor: \u2018flame\u2019 - eventuality: \u2018blaze\u2019 \u2192 tenor: \u2018spark\u2019\nTable 2 summarises the different characteristics and textual clues used to identify each potential simile component."}, {"heading": "3.2. Filtering of frozen similes", "text": "In order to detect frozen similes, all ground/eventuality + vehicle couples were first compared to a list of frozen similes of the corresponding language, compiled from different sources such as Les Comparaisons du fran\u00e7ais by Nicolas Cazelles (1996) or Dictionnaire fran\u00e7ais/anglais des comparaisons by Michel Parmentier (2002). Since the reference lists of frozen similes were mostly based on sources that were not contemporary with the novels of the corpus and were by no means comprehensive, frequency and semantic distance were used to single out frozen similes among the remaining ground/eventuality + vehicle couples. All ground/eventuality + vehicle couples that appeared at least 5 times in novels by different authors were thus selected. Then, the semantic distance between the tenor and the vehicle in each sentence was assessed. When both the tenor and the vehicle were nouns, their semantic categories were extracted from two machine-readable dictionaries: Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) and Le Dictionnaire \u00e9lectronique des mots (Dubois & Dubois-Charlier, 2010) for English and French respectively. As far as Wordnet is concerned, the number of the noun\u2019s corresponding lexicographer files, which precedes the term in every definition, was taken as its semantic category. For Le Dictionnaire \u00e9lectronique des mots, three semantic categories are provided: \u2018animal\u2019 and \u2018humain\u2019 (human being) and \u2018nonanim\u00e9\u2019 (inanimate). Semantic distance, however, required manual disambiguation in the following cases: - when different semantic categories were attributed to either the tenor or the vehicle;\n- when an English tenor or vehicle was classified as a unique beginner for nouns; - when both French nouns were tagged as \u2018non-anim\u00e9\u2019; - when the ground/eventuality + vehicle couple only used a personal pronoun as\ntenor."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4. 1. Presentation of the corpus", "text": "The two corpora used for this experiment were built with digital versions of literary texts in the public domain collected mainly from the Project Gutenberg website2 and from the Biblioth\u00e8que \u00e9lectronique du Qu\u00e9bec3, for British and French novels respectively. Most of the novels included in the corpus were written during the 19th century so as to ensure linguistic homogeneity and because that century witnessed the\n2 www.gutenberg.org 3 beq.ebooksgratuits.com\nnovel imposing itself as a predominant literary genre. In addition, a ratio of least 3 novels per writer was observed and the novels were not restricted to a specific literary genre. This method enabled to create a corpus of 1191 British novels authored by 62 writers and a corpus of 746 French penned by 57 novelists. In terms of size, the British corpus contains 152,941,750 tokens and its French counterpart, 119,914,914 tokens."}, {"heading": "4.2. Description of detected frozen similes", "text": "The rather low number of total occurrences of the top frozen similes in each language (listed in Table 3) seems to confirm the fact that clich\u00e9s in general and frozen similes in particular are far from being common in literary texts. In addition, French novelists are more inclined to use frozen similes than British ones. One striking result of this study is the fact that the same simile (pale + marker + death and p\u00e2le + marker + mort) is the most frequently used in both languages. This simile is also interesting in itself, from a stylistic point of view, as it assigns a human feature to an abstract entity. As a matter of fact, \u2018pale\u2019 and its synonym, \u2018white\u2019, appear several times in the most frequent similes. Similarly, \u2018death\u2019 is used in three of the top frozen English similes. Apart from the fact that \u2018paleness\u2019 mostly characterises humans, its context of occurrence suggests that it is generally used to stress somebody\u2019s distress or fear in reaction to a particular news or event or the impression that the narrator has of a protagonist, most often in rather such sentences for maximal effect such as in: \u201cThe old Cavalier looked pale as death, and greatly agitated\u201d.\nFurthermore, several detected frozen similes, in fact, are variants of another frozen simile. Frequency could therefore help to determine the main simile that the others seek to replace. For example, \u2018motionless + marker + statue\u2019, \u2018rigid + marker + statue\u2019, \u2018motionless + marker + image\u2019 are all non-idiomatic variations of \u2018immobile + marker + statue\u2019. Still based on their frequency in each corpus, it is possible to propose a scale of clich\u00e9dness that can further describe similes for stylistic analysis. For instance, \u2018white as the snow\u201d would be a prominent literary clich\u00e9, while \u2018heavy + marker + lead\u2019 (42 occurrences) would be a medium literary clich\u00e9 and \u2018harmless + marker + dove\u2019 (6 occurrences) would be a relatively rare literary clich\u00e9.\nAs far as compositionality is concerned, some frozen similes use various markers while others always use the same one, especially when they make use of the comparative forms \u201cmore/less\u2026 than\u201d. In addition, some frozen similes tend to always be associated with the same tenor or different tenors belonging to the same semantic fields. Examples of this type of similes include \u2018eyes + wide + saucers\u2019, cheveu +noir + aile de corbeau\u2019, \u2018 nez +recourb\u00e9 + bec\u2019 and \u2018yeux + br\u00fbler/briller + charbon\u2019. In this respect, it is possible to say that some literary frozen similes are restricted to specific cognitive associations, so much so that they come automatically in mind when one wants to describe a particular state of a precise entity."}, {"heading": "5. CONCLUSION", "text": "The aim of this paper was to study frozen literary similes in a corpus of novels written in English and in French. If the greater part of the extraction of similes and of their components was done automatically, the recognition of frozen similes still relies partially on human knowledge. In this respect, it seems necessary for future work to research how to disambiguate first the tenor or the vehicle so as to find directly its cprresponding semantic category. Since this study is mostly oriented towards a stylistic description of similes, another perspective would be to add information about the literary clich\u00e9dness of a particular simile to a simile mining system, in order to shade new light on the perception and interpretation of frozen similes in literature as a whole."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by French state funds managed the ANR within the Investissements d'Avenir programme under the reference ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02."}], "references": [{"title": "A Glossary of Literary Terms", "author": ["M.H.
