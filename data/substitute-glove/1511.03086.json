Extending machine learning from traditional singletable methods to multi-relational data is an important direction for practical applications. The statistical and algorithmic challenges that arise from multirelational data have been addressed in a number of research communities, such as Statistical-Relational Learning, Multi-Relational Data Mining, and Inductive Logic Programming. Experience with the UCI Machine Learning Repository1 has shown that a shared repository of benchmark datasets facilitates research progress [1]. The UCI Machine Learning Repository contains mainly datasets\n1http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/\nstored in a single data table. Our goal is to provide a similar service for the relational learning community for relational datasets that contain multiple interrelated tables."}, {"heading": "2 Design", "text": "The repository is maintained in a public MySQL server hosted by Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague. Each dataset is stored as a MySQL database on the server. Different formats have been introduced for storing multi-relational data. The advantages of using the SQL (SQL stands for \u201cStructured Query Language\u201d) format include the following.\n\u2022 The SQL format is a based on a standard widely used in industry. Using SQL databases in machine learning facilitates cross-community knowledge transfer and collaborations between machine learning and database researchers.\n\u2022 Because SQL is a common standard, many programming environments support accessing and processing SQL data. This includes machine learning and statistical platforms such as R, Clowdflows [4], RapidMiner, and Weka. All general application languages provide SQL database connectivity, including Python, Java, and C++.\n\u2022 The data description facilities of SQL provide a standard for defining metadata about the structure of the dataset. For example, information about the entities linked by a relationship is specified using primary and foreign keys. This metadata is recorded in the system catalog, and can be queried by machine learning applications.\nTo facilitate using tools developed for other relational data formats, we have provided scripts for converting MySQL data to other common data formats used in relational learning http://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~oschulte/jbn/DataConversion/MLN.html. This includes the Wisconsin Logic Learning format (WILL) and the .db format used in the Alchemy system. The ClowdFlows system also provides data format conversion, for example from MySQL to the Aleph Inductive Logic Programming Format2."}, {"heading": "3 Content", "text": "The repository currently contains 50 databases. This includes common benchmark datasets used in relational learning, like eastbound/westbound train dataset [5] or biodegradability dataset [2]. We have also aimed at providing a diversity of databases, for instance in terms of the number of records and in terms of the\n2http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/aleph.html\ncomplexity of the relational schema. Hence, also synthetic datasets from different database vendors are included, as they are designed to show off capabilities of their database software. An example of such a synthetic dataset is Adventure Works, which is interesting not only because of its complexity, but also because:\n\u2022 it uses both, simple and composite keys;\n\u2022 it contains a diverse set of data types, including datetime, blob (images) and geometry;\n\u2022 it contains missing values."}, {"heading": "4 Access and Contributions", "text": "Read-only access can be obtained via a database connection with the following parameters.\nHostname relational.fit.cvut.cz\nPort 3306\nUsername guest\nPassword relational\nTo contribute a database, please contact the repository administrators; a web contact form is available https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/contact.

The meaning of the columns is as follows.\n#Relations The number of tables in the database.\n#Instances Count of rows in the target table.\nSize Size in MB including indexes.\nType The dataset is either a measurement or synthetically generated.\nDomain The original domain.\nTask Classification or regression.\nThe name of the meta-database schema is meta.

The name of the table that contains information about the databases is meta.information. Some of this metadata is automatically exported in HTML format for display on the web page relational.fit.cvut.cz. In the following, we list the names of the main column and their meaning. When we refer to \u201call columns\u201d or \u201call rows\u201d, we mean all columns/rows of all tables in a database. The metadata contain the following main groups of information: basic database statistics, information about columns or fields, foreign key structure, classification information."}, {"heading": "5.1 Basic Database Statistics", "text": "Various basic properties, such as record count and missing values.\nrow count The total number of rows, or records.\nrow max The maximum number of rows, or records, in a single table.\ncolumn count The total number of columns, or fields.\ndownload url A URL containing further information about the dataset, such as provenance.\nnull count The number of table entries with null values; typically this is the number of table entries with missing values."}, {"heading": "5.2 Column Information", "text": "These columns contain metainformation about the types of columns/fields/attributes in the database tables.

Chen et al. propose visualizing the foreign key relationships in a semantic relationship graph [3]: The graph contains a directed edge from table T to table T \u2032 if table T references T \u2032 in a foreign key constraint.

An example of a loop is when between a person table and a university table exists two foreign keys - the first foreign key signifies that a person is studying at a university, while the second foreign key signifies that the person is teaching at the university."}, {"heading": "5.4 Classification", "text": "Many of the databases in the repository have been used to study classification in relational data.
