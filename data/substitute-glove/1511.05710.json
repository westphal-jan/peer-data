This is the starting point to develop the new formulation for the complex-valued GPR. The obtained formulation resembles the one of the widely linear minimum mean-squared (WLMMSE) approach. Just in the particular case where the outputs are proper, the pseudo-kernel cancels and the solution simplifies to a real-valued GPR structure, as the WLMMSE does into a strictly linear solution.

The study of linear solutions for complex-valued signals has been addressed in detail in\nThis work was supported by the Spanish government (Ministerio de Educacio\u0301n y Ciencia, TEC2012-38800-C03-02), and by the European Union (FEDER) and Junta de Andaluc\u0301\u0131a (TIC-155).

A proper complex random signal is uncorrelated with its complex conjugate (Neeser and Massey, 1993). In the proper scenario, solutions for the realvalued case can be usually rewritten for the complexvalued scenario by just replacing transpose by Hermitian. However, in the improper case, the solutions are more involved and the concept of widely linear is introduced. Accordingly, the linear minimum meansquared error (LMMSE) can be simply rewritten by taking into account the covariance between two random vectors. However, if the outputs are improper, an additional term must be added to include the pseudocovariance (Adali et al., 2011; Schreier and Scharf, 2010). Hence, both covariance and pseudo-covariance must be taken into account.\nMany non-linear tools for complex fields have been developed within the artificial neural network research community (Danilo P. Mandic, 2009; Hirose, 2013). In kernel methods, we may find a few results for kernel principal analysis (Papaioannou and Zafeiriou, 2014), classification (Steinwart et al., 2006) or regression (Ogunfunmi and Paul, 2011; Bouboulis et al., 2012; Tobar et al., 2012; Boloix-Tortosa et al., 2014). These solutions are usually introduced as a complexificacion of the kernel (Bouboulis et al., 2012). In the complexification approach, real-valued kernel tools are adapted to the complex-valued scenario by just rewriting the kernel to deal with complex-valued outputs, and inputs. However, as discussed above for linear solutions, this may suffice for the proper case, but not for the general one. Bearing this in mind, we investigate in this paper how pseudo-covariance matrices should be included in the solutions. In particular, we focus in Gaussian process for regression (GPR).\nGaussian processes (GPs) are kernel Bayesian tools for discriminative machine learning (O\u2019Hagan and Kingman, 1978; Rasmussen and Williams, 2006; Pe\u0301rez-Cruz et al., 2013). They have been successfully applied to regression, classification and dimensionality reduction.\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n05 71\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n8 N\nov 2\n01 5\nGPs can be interpreted as a family of kernel methods with the additional advantage of providing a full conditional statistical description for the predicted variable. Also, hyperparameters can be learned by maximizing the marginal likelihood, avoiding cross-validation. For real fields, GPs applied to regression can be casted as a non-linear MMSE (Pe\u0301rez-Cruz et al., 2013): they present a similar structure as the LMMSE, where we replace the linear covariances by kernels, and the regularization term also depends on the prior of the weights of the generalized regression (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). In the following, we propose to develop a new formulation of GPR for complex-valued signals. We start analyzing the prediction for the real and imaginary part separately. Then we merge the results into a complex-valued formulation. In the general improper case, we show that the solution depends on both a kernel and a pseudo-kernel, to propose a widely complex GPR (WCGPR)."}, {"heading": "2 Widely linear MMSE (WLMMSE) estimation", "text": "In this section we review the widely concept for complex-valued signals by describing the widely linear minimum mean-squared error (WLMMSE) estimation. The WLMMSE estimation of a zero-mean signal f\u2022 : \u2126 \u2192 Cd from the zero-mean measurement y : \u2126\u2192 Cn is (Picinbono and Chevalier, 1995; Schreier and Scharf, 2010)\nf\u0302\u2022 = W1y + W2y \u2217, (1)\nor by making use of the augmented notation, where the complex signals are stacked on their conjugates:\nf\u0302\u2022 = [ f\u0302\u2022 f\u0302\u2217\u2022 ] = W y = [ W1 W2 W\u22172 W \u2217 1 ] [ y y\u2217 ] . (2)\nThe widely linear estimator is determined such that the mean-squared error is minimized, i.e., the error between the augmented estimator and the augmented signal, e = f\u0302\u2022 \u2212 f\u2022 , must be orthogonal to the augmented measurement, y, (Picinbono and Chevalier, 1995; Schreier and Scharf, 2010):\nW = Rf\u2022yR \u22121 yy = [ Rf\u2022y R\u0303f\u2022y R\u0303\u2217f\u2022y R \u2217 f\u2022y ] [ Ryy R\u0303yy R\u0303\u2217yy R \u2217 yy ]\u22121 ,\n(3)\nwhere Ryy is the augmented covariance matrix of the\nmeasurements, with covariance matrix Ryy = E [ yyH ] and pseudo-covariance or complementary covariance matrix R\u0303yy = E [ yy> ] . Similarly, Rf\u2022y is composed\nby Rf\u2022y = E [ f\u2022yH ] and R\u0303f\u2022y = E [ f\u2022y> ] .

Finally, the error covariance matrix Q = E [ eeH ] of the error vector e = f\u0302\u2022 \u2212 f\u2022 is (Schreier and Scharf, 2010)\nQ = Rf\u2022f\u2022 \u2212 [ Rf\u2022y \u2212 R\u0303f\u2022yR\u2212\u2217yyR\u0303\u2217yy ] P\u22121yyR H f\u2022y\n\u2212 [ R\u0303f\u2022y \u2212Rf\u2022yR\u22121yyR\u0303yy ] P\u2212\u2217yyR\u0303 H f\u2022y.

We first face the case where real and imaginary parts are estimated separately, to later merge the solutions into one complex-valued expression in the next section.\nGP for regression can be presented as a nonlinear regressor that expresses the input-output relation through function f(x), known as latent function, that follows a GP and underlies the regression problem\ny = f(x) + , (7)\nwhere the input vector is x \u2208 Cd, and the error is modeled as additive zero-mean Gaussian noise.\nGiven a training set D = {(x(i), y(i))|i = 1, ..., n} = {Xn,yn}, we aggregate the input vectors as columns in matrix Xn and the outputs are stacked in the complex column vector y = [y(1), ..., y(n)] > = f(Xn) +\n= f + .

Javier Paya\u0301n-Somet, Juan J. Murillo-Fuentes\nThe straightforward way of applying GPR to complex signals is to process a composite vector where we append the imaginary values to the real ones. Then two GPs can be learned, one for the real part and another for the imaginary part of the output, either independently or using a multi-output learning or vector scheme (Micchelli and Pontil, 2005; Boyle and Frean, 2005; A\u0301lvarez et al., 2012). The model in (7) can be rewritten in composite form as\nyR = [ yr yj ] = [ fr(Xn) fj(Xn) ] + [ r j ] = fR(Xn) + R,\n(8)\nwhere yR, fR and R are the composite (real) vectors for the outputs, the latent function and the noise, respectively. We assume that the real additive noise R is i.i.d. Gaussian with zero mean and variance \u03a3 R . If we assume a zero mean process and specify the covariance function of the process kR(xi,xl), we can write out the corresponding 2n \u00d7 2n covariance matrix KR(Xn,Xn) elementwise from Xn, and generate the Gaussian prior fR \u223c N (0,KR(Xn,Xn)). Therefore, the observations are also Gaussian distributed, yR \u223c N (0,KR(Xn,Xn) + \u03a3 R) = N (0,CR), and the joint distribution of the training outputs, yR, and the test predictions fR\u2022 = fR\u2022(X\u2022) according to the prior yield [\nyR fR\u2022\n] \u223c N ( 0, [ CR KR(Xn,X\u2022)\nKR(X\u2022,Xn) KR(X\u2022,X\u2022)\n]) .\n(9)\nThe conditional distribution for the predictions fR\u2022 given the observations yields the predictive distribution\nfR\u2022|X?,X,yR \u223c N (\u00b5fR\u2022 ,\u03a3fR\u2022) , (10) and we arrive at the key predictive equations for GPR, the mean and variance given by:\n\u00b5fR\u2022 = KR(X\u2022,Xn)C \u22121 R yR, (11) \u03a3fR\u2022 = KR(X\u2022,X\u2022)\u2212KR(X\u2022,Xn)C\u22121R KR(Xn,X\u2022). (12)\nNote that in the predictions (11) and (12) we have matrices Krr, Krj, Kjr and Kjj, that are block matrices in the vector kernel matrix\nKR(Xn,Xn) = [ Krr(Xn,Xn) Krj(Xn,Xn) Kjr(Xn,Xn) Kjj(Xn,Xn) ] .\n(13)"}, {"heading": "4 Widely Complex Gaussian Process Regression", "text": "The model in (7) can also be rewritten in the augmented vector notation by stacking the complex sig-\nnals on their conjugates:\ny = [ y y\u2217 ] = [ f(Xn) f\u2217(Xn) ] + [ \u2217 ] = f(Xn) +\n= f + , (14)\nwhere y, f and are the augmented vectors for the outputs, the latent function vector and the noise, respectively.

In this example, the filters used were parameterized exponentials:\nh(x) = v exp ( \u2212x Hx\n\u03b3\n) , (24)\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.6 and v = 4 for hr1(x), v = 5 for hj1(x), v = 1 for hr2(x), and v = \u22123 for hj2(x). We generated 100 samples in [\u22125, 5] for both the real and the imaginary parts of the inputs to get a set of 10000 complex-valued inputs, and the filters were normalized to have unit norm. The real part of sample function f(x) obtained is shown in Figure 2 (top).\nComplex Gaussian noise with variance \u03c32 and complementary variance \u03c1\u03c32 was added to represent measurement uncertainty. In this example we set \u03c3 = 0.0165 and \u03c1 = 0.8 exp(j3\u03c0/2). A set of n = 500 training noisy samples were randomly chosen. These samples have been epicted as circles in Figure 2 (top).\nWe calculated the mean (19) and variance (20) of the predictive distributio using the training samples. The\nRafael Boloix-Tortosa, Eva Arias-de-Reyna, F. Javier Paya\u0301n-Somet, Juan J. Murillo-Fuentes\nreal part of the predictive mean (19) is depicted in Figure 2 (bottom). The mean squared error of the estimation was 10 log10MSE = \u221212.6 dB, computed for 10000 inputs. In Figure 3 a slice of the surface in Figure 2 is shown. The real part of the sample function of the process is plotted (black line) versus the real part of the input, the imaginary part of the input (x) was fixed to the value 0.4545. The real part of the prediction in (19) is depicted in red line, along with the grey shaded area that represents the pointwise mean plus and minus two times the standard deviation. The blue circles mark the training samples.\nWe have also compared the predictive capabilities of the proposed widely complex GPR in (19) with that of the prediction for the proper case in (21). In Figure 3 the mean of the prediction in (21) is plotted as a blue line. It is shown that the proposed WGPR prediction is always closer to the actual value of f(x) than the prediction for the proper case, as expected.\nFinally, in Figure 4 we compare the mean square error of the estimation of the same f(x) as before for the proposed WCGPR (19) and the proper case estimation (21) versus the number of training samples. The noise variance was increased to \u03c3 = 0.165 in order to check the good behavior of the proposed complexvalued regressor under a ten-fold higher noise level.\nAll other parameters were set to the same values used in the previous experiments. It can be seen in Figure 4 that the proposed widely complex GPR performs better that the proper case estimation, with a reduction in the MSE close to 2 dB at its best."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We have shown that developing complex-valued nonlinear kernel based solutions does not suffice to replace kernels by its complex versions. In the general case, another kernel matrix, the so-called pseudokernel matrix must be included. We have focused on GPR to develop a novel formulation, denoted as\nwidely non-linear complex-valued GPR (WCGPR), after the widely linear MMSE, as it exhibits a quite similar structure. The pseudo-kernel or pseudo-covariance matrix in this formulation models the covariance between the outputs and their conjugates. If this pseudo-covariance cancels, i.e. the outputs are proper, WCGPR yields a strict non-linear complex formulation, as the WLMMSE yields a strict LMMSE. Other special cases can be also derived from this general solution. Through numerical experiments we show that the proposed formulation outperforms the strictly nonlinear complex-valued GPR when learning a complex Gaussian process generated using widely linear filters."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2015, "abstractText": "In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian kernel based solution for regression in complex fields. We develop the formulation of the Gaussian process for regression (GPR) to deal with complex-valued outputs. Previous solutions for kernels methods usually assume a complexification approach, where the real-valued kernel is replaced by a complexvalued one. However, based on the results in complex-valued linear theory, we prove that both a kernel and a pseudo-kernel are to be included in the solution. This is the starting point to develop the new formulation for the complex-valued GPR. The obtained formulation resembles the one of the widely linear minimum mean-squared (WLMMSE) approach. Just in the particular case where the outputs are proper, the pseudo-kernel cancels and the solution simplifies to a real-valued GPR structure, as the WLMMSE does into a strictly linear solution. We include some numerical experiments to show that the novel solution, denoted as widely non-linear complex GPR (WCGPR), outperforms a strictly complex GPR where a pseudo-kernel is not included.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
