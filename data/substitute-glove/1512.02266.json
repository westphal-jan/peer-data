Introduction", "text": "Many discrete statistical problems in a variety of domains are nowadays often modeled using Bayesian networks (BNs) [35]. There are now thousands of practical applications of these models [1, 7, 25, 26], which have spawned many useful technical developments: for instance, a variety of fast exact, approximate and symbolic propagation algorithms for the computation of probabilities that exploit the underlying graph structure [14, 16, 17]. Some of these advances are hard-wired into software [9, 28, 32] which further favored the applicability and success of these models.\nHowever, BN modelling would not have experienced such a widespread application without tailored methodologies of model validation, i.e. for checking that a model produces outputs that are in line with current understanding, following a defensible and expected mechanism [19, 38]. Such techniques are now well established for BN models [12, 28, 38, 39]. These techniques are especially fundamental for expert elicited models, where both the probabilities and the covariance structure are defined from the suggestions of domains experts, following knowledge engineering protocols tailored to the BN\u2019s bulding process [34, 40]. We can broadly categorize the validation process in two steps: the first concerns the auditing of the underlying graphical structure; the second, assuming the graph represents a user\u2019s beliefs, checks the impact of the elicited probabilities within this parametric family on outputs of interest. The focus of this paper lies in this second validation phase, usually called a sensitivity analysis.\nThe most common investigation is the so-called one-way sensitivity analysis, where the impacts of changes of one probability parameter at a time are studied. Analyses where more than one parameter at a time is varied are usually referred to as multi-way. In both cases a complete sensitivity analysis entails the study of Chan-Darwiche (CD) distances [9, 10, 11] and sensitivity functions [13, 21]. The CD distance is used to quantify global changes. It measures how the overall distribution behaves when one (or more) parameter is varied. A great portion of research has focused on identifying parameter changes such that the original and the \u2018varied\u2019 BN distributions are close in CD distance [11, 41]. This is minimized when, after a single arbitrary parameter change, other covarying parameters, e.g. those from the same conditional distributions, have the same proportion of the residual probability mass as they originally\nPreprint submitted to Artificial Intelligence October 23, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n02 26\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n7 D\nec 2\n01 5\nhad. Sensitivity functions, on the other hand, model local changes with respect to an output of interest. These describe how that output probability varies as one (or potentially more) parameter is allowed to be changed. Although both these concepts can be applied to generic Bayesian analyses, they have almost exclusively been discussed and applied only within the BN literature. This is because the computations of both CD distances and sensitivity functions are particularly straightforward for BN models.\nIn this paper we introduce a unifying comprehensive framework for one-way analyses by investigating models from a polynomial point of view. Using the notion of an interpolating polynomial [36] we are able to describe a large variety of models based on their polynomial form. We demonstrate that sensitivity methods defined for BNs straightforwardly generalize to any model whose interpolating polynomial is multilinear, for example context-specific BNs [6] and chain event graphs [3, 42]. We will extensively focus on this latter class of asymmetric models which are built by merging certain vertices of a probability tree whose associated probabilities are identified. Both the BN and the context-specific BN model class can be seen as a subset of the class of CEGs, which enables users to model a large variety of asymmetric conditional independences. Methodologies to embellish CEG modeling are now in place, for instance learning algorithms [15], causal reasoning [45] and inference routines [22, 44]. However, sensitivity methods tailored to CEGs have not been introduced yet, which would become fundamental for the application of these models in real-world problems.\nBy studying sensitivity analysis from a polynomial point of view we are able to consider a much larger class of models for which such methods are not currently available. We investigate the properties of sensitivity analysis in models whose interpolating polynomial is not multilinear, which are usually associated to dynamic settings where probabilities are recursively defined. As we will show below, this difference gives us an even richer class of sensitivity functions, which are not simply linear as in the BN and multilinear one-way case. We further introduce a procedure to compute the CD distance in these models and demonstrate that no unique updating of covarying parameters lead to the smallest distance between the original and the varied distribution.\nWe then conclude the paper relating multi-way methods in multilinear models, where many parameters are contemporaneously allowed to vary, to one-way methods in models whose interpolating polynomial is non-multilinear. Multi-way methods have not been extensively discussed in the literature: see [5, 10] for some exceptions. Importantly, our approach will allow us to prove that multi-way analyses - usually called in the context of BNs single full conditional probability table (CPT) analyses - where one parameter from each CPT of one vertex of a BN given each configurations of its parents is optimal under proportional covariation in the sense that minimizes the CD distance between the original and the varied distribution. The optimality of this covariation method has been an open problem in the sensitivity analysis literature for quite some time [10]. This result gives a further incentive in investigating sensitivity methods through the polynomial definition of parametric models we introduce next."}, {"heading": "2. Multilinear and polynomial parametric models", "text": "In this section we first provide a generic definition of a parametric statistical model together with the notion of interpolating polynomial. We then categorize parametric models according to the form of their interpolating polynomials and show that many commonly used models fall within two classes.\n2.1. Parametric models and interpolating polynomials Let Y = (Y1, . . . , Ym) be a random vector with an associated discrete and finite sample space Y, with #Y = n. Although our methods straightforwardly applies when the entries of Y are random vectors, for ease of notation, we henceforth assume its elements are univariate.\nDefinition 1. Denote by p\u03b8 = (p\u03b8(y) | y \u2208 Y) the vector of values of a probability mass function p\u03b8 : Y \u2192 [0, 1] which depends on a choice of parameters \u03b8 \u2208 Rk. The entries of p\u03b8 are called atomic probabilities and the elements y \u2208 Y atoms. Definition 2. A discrete parametric statistical model on n \u2208 N atoms is a subset P\u03a8 \u2286 \u2206n\u22121 of the n \u2212 1 dimensional probability simplex, where \u03a8 : Rk \u2192 P\u03a8, \u03b8 7\u2192 p\u03b8, (1) is a bijective map identifying a particular choice of parameters \u03b8 \u2208 Rk with one vector of atomic probabilities. The map \u03a8 is called a parametrisation of the model.\nThe above definition is often encountered in the field of algebraic statistics, where properties of statistical models are studied using techniques from algebraic geometry and commutative computer algebra, among others [18, 37]. We next follow [23] in extending some standard terminology.\nDefinition 3. A model P\u03a8 \u2286 \u2206n\u22121 has a monomial parametrisation if\np\u03b8(y) = \u03b8\u03b1y , for all y \u2208 Y,\nwhere \u03b1y \u2208 Nk0 denotes a vector of exponents and \u03b8\u03b1y = \u03b8 \u03b11,y 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03b8 \u03b1k,y k is a monomial. Then equation (1) is a monomial map and \u03b8\u03b1y \u2208 Rk[\u0398], for all y \u2208 Y. Here \u0398 = {\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8k} is the set of indeterminates and Rk[\u0398] is the polynomial ring over the field R.\nFor models entertaining a monomial parametrisation the network polynomial we introduce in Definition 4 below concisely captures the model structure and provides a platform to answer inferential queries [17, 22].\nDefinition 4. The network polynomial of a model P\u03a8 with monomial parametrisation \u03a8 is given by cP\u03a8 (\u03b8, \u03bb) = \u2211 y\u2208Y p\u03b8(y) = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A \u03bby\u03b8 \u03b1,\nwhere \u03bby is an indicator function for the atom y and A = {\u03b1y | y \u2208 Y} \u2282 Nk0.\nProbabilities of events in the underlying sigma-field can be computed from the network polynomial by setting equal to one the indicator function of atoms associated to that event. In the following it will be convenient to work with a special case of the network polynomial where all the indicator functions are set to one.\nDefinition 5. The interpolating polynomial of a model P\u03a8 with monomial parametrisation \u03a8 is given by the sum of all atomic probabilities, cP\u03a8 (\u03b8) = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A \u03b8\u03b1.\n2.2. Multilinear models\nIn this work we will mostly focus on parametric models whose interpolating polynomial is multilinear.\nDefinition 6. We say that a parametric model P\u03a8 is multilinear if its associated interpolating polynomial is multilinear, i.e. if A \u2286 {0, 1}k.\nWe note here that a great portion of well-known non-dynamic graphical models are multilinear. We explicitly show below that this is the case for BNs, context-specific BNs [6] and certain CEG models. In addition, decomposable undirected graphs [30] and probabilistic chain graphs [20] can be defined to have a monomial parametrisation whose associated interpolating polynomial is multilinear.\n2.2.1. Bayesian networks For an m \u2208 N, let [m] = {1, . . . , m}. We denote with Yi, i \u2208 [m], a generic discrete random variable and with Yi = {0, . . . , mi} its associated sample space. For an A \u2286 [m], we let YA = (Yi)i\u2208A and YA = \u00d7i\u2208AYi.\nDefinition 7. A BN over a discrete random vector Y[m] consists of\n\u2022 m \u2212 1 conditional independence statements of the form Yi \u22a5 Y[i\u22121] |Y\u03a0i , where \u03a0i \u2286 [i \u2212 1];\n\u2022 a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G with vertex set V(G) = {Yi : i \u2208 [m]} and edge set E(G) = {(Yi, Y j) : j \u2208 [m], i \u2208 \u03a0 j};\n\u2022 conditional probabilities \u03b8i j\u03c0 = Pr(Yi = j | Y\u03a0i = \u03c0) for every j \u2208 Yi, \u03c0 \u2208 Y\u03a0i and i \u2208 [m].\nFrom [10] we know that for any atom y \u2208 Y[m] its associated monomial in the network polynomial can be written as\np\u03b8(y) = \u220f\ny\u223c{i j,\u03c0} \u03bbi j\u03b8i j\u03c0,\nwhere \u223c denotes the compatibility relation among instantiations.\nLemma 1. From [17, 22], the interpolating polynomial of a BN model can be written as cBN(\u03b8) = \u2211\ny\u2208Y[m] \u220f y\u223c{i j,\u03c0} \u03b8i j\u03c0. (2)\nFrom Equation (2) we can immediately deduce the following.\nProposition 1. A BN is a multilinear parametric model, whose interpolating polynomial is homogeneous with monomials of degree m.\nExample 1. Suppose a newborn is at risk of acquiring a disease and her parents are offered a screening test (Y1) which can be either positive (Y1 = 2), negative (Y1 = 2) or inconclusive (Y1 = 0). Given that the newborn either acquired (Y2 = 1) or not (Y2 = 0) the disease, her parents can then decide whether or not to give her a vaccine to prevent a relapse (Y3 = 1 and Y3 = 0, respectively). We assume that the parents\u2019 decision about the vaccine does not depend on the screening test if the newborn contracted the disease, and that the probability of choosing vaccination is the same for inconclusive and positive screening evidence when the newborn does not acquire the disease.\nThe above situation can be described, with some loss of information, by the BN in Figure 1, with probabilities\nPr(Y1 = i) = \u03b81i , Pr(Y2 = j |Y1 = i) = \u03b82 j1i , Pr(Y3 = k |Y2 = j, Y1 = i) = \u03b83k2 j1i .\nIts associated network polynomial has degree 2m = 6 and equals\ncBN(\u03b8, \u03bb) = 2\u2211\ni=0 1\u2211 j=0 1\u2211 k=0 \u03bb1i\u03bb2 j\u03bb3k\u03b81i\u03b82 j1i\u03b83k2 j1i .\n2.2.2. Context-specific Bayesian networks In practice it has been recognized that often conditional independence statements do not hold over the whole sample space of certain conditioning variables but only for a subset of this, usually referred to as a context. A variety of methods have been introduced to embellish a BN with additional independence statements that hold only over contexts. A BN equipped with such embellishments is usually called context-specific BN. Here we consider the representation known as context specific independence (CSI)-trees and introduced in [6].\nExample 2. Consider the medical problem in Example 1. Using the introduced notation, we notice that by assumption, for each k = 0, 1, the probabilities \u03b83k211i , \u03b83k211 are equal for all i = 0, 1, 2. Also \u03b83k2010 = \u03b83k2012 , \u03b83k201 are equal. These equations can be represented by the CSI-tree in Figure 2, where the inner nodes are random variables and the leaves are entries of the CPTs of one vertex. The tree shows that, if Y2 = 1 then no matter what the value of Y1 is, the CPT for Y3 = k will be equal to \u03b83k211. Furthermore, as shown in the left hand side of the tree, the probability that Y3 = k is equal when {Y2 = 0, Y1 = 0} and {Y2 = 0, Y1 = 2}. The network polynomial of the context-specific BN described by the DAG in Figure 1 and the CSI-tree in Figure 2 corresponds to the polynomial in equation (2) where the appropriate indeterminates are substituted with \u03b83k211 and \u03b83k201. This polynomial is again multilinear and homogeneous, just like for all context-specific BNs embellished with CSI-trees.\n2.2.3. Staged trees and chain event graphs We next consider models represented by trees. These are able to capture more general asymmetric conditional independence statements. Let T = (V , E), with E \u2282 V \u00d7 V , be a directed rooted tree where each inner vertex v \u2208 V , also called situation, has at least two children. In this graph representation, the set of root-to-leaf paths RT is in oneto-one correspondence with the sample space of an underlying model. We write r = (e | e \u2208 E(r)) \u2208 RT for one such path, which is a sequence of edges E(r) \u2282 E. We assume that every edge e = (v, v\u2032) \u2208 E has a primitive probability label \u03b8e \u2208 (0, 1) which can be thought of as the transition probability from v to v\u2032. These labels are assumed to obey local summing-to-unity constraints in the sense that \u2211 e\u2208E(v) \u03b8e = 1 where E(v) \u2286 E is the set of edges emanating from v \u2208 V . For a situation v, F (v) = (v, E(v)) and \u03b8v = (\u03b8e | e \u2208 E(v)) are called a floret and a (floret) parameter vector, respectively. Set \u0398T = {\u03b8v | v \u2208 V} to be the set of parameter vectors associated to a tree. Then, the probability of an atom in the model space is given by the product of primitive probabilities along the edges of its path representation, p\u03b8(r) = \u220f e\u2208E(r) \u03b8e. We call the pair (T , \u0398T ) a probability tree.\nDefinition 8. We call a probability tree a staged tree if for some v, v\u2032 \u2208 V , the corresponding floret parameter vectors are identified \u03b8v = \u03b8v\u2032 . Then, v and v\u2032 are said to be in the same stage.\nBeing in the same stage thus implies that the associated transition probabilities of two different vertices are identified. Thus, staged trees depict information on context-specific conditional independence of the type discussed in Section 2.2.2. When drawing a tree, vertices in the same stage are equally framed in order to have a visual counterpart for that information. A second partition of the situations of a tree is as follows.\nDefinition 9. We say that two situations v and v\u2032 are in the same position if the induced subtrees with roots v and v\u2032 have the same graph and the same vertex framing. We let W denote the set of positions of a staged tree.\nNote that all leaves are trivially in the same stage, denoted w\u221e. Two situations in the same position are by definition also in the same stage, whilst it does not necessary follow that two situations in the same stage are also in the same position.\nExample 3. Consider the problem described in Example 1. The associated BN representation could be transformed into a staged tree where all the vertices are in different stages. However, if we straightforwardly build a staged tree for the situation described in the example, we can visually model all the asymmetric conditional independence constraints as shown in Figure 3. In particular in this case the stages, which are also positions, are\nw1 = {v1}, w2 = {v2}, w3 = {v3}, w4 = {v4}, w5 = {v5, v9}, w6 = {v6, v8, v10}, w7 = {v7}.\nAlthough staged trees have the capability of modeling much more complex problems than BNs, their size usually becomes unmanageable when the sample space grows moderately. However, a convenient representation of a staged tree model is via a CEG [3, 42], which is less cluttered and can more concisely describe its conditional independence statements.\nDefinition 10. A CEG C = C(T ) is the graph obtained by collapsing a staged tree T into its positions. Its vertex set, V(C), is equal to W\u222a{w\u221e}, where positions in the same stage are equally framed. Its edge set, E(C), is such that there is an edge (wi, w j), wi, w j \u2208W, for every edge from a generic vertex vi \u2208 wi to any vertex v j \u2208 w j.\nExample 4. Figure 4 shows the CEG representation of the staged tree in Figure 3.\nJust as for staged trees, the set of root-to-leaf paths RC of a CEG is in one-to-one correspondence with the sample space of the underlying model. Note that here two different paths might go through the same sequence of positions, but not through the exactly same sequence of edges. We write r = (e | e \u2208 E(r)) \u2208 RC for one such path, which is a sequence of edges E(r) \u2208 E(C). The CEG inherits from the associated staged trees the primitive probabilities \u03b8e \u2208 (0, 1), describing the likelihood of going from position w to w\u2032, for e = (w, w\u2032). The probability of an atom is again simply the product of the primitive probabilities along the edges of its paths, \u03c0\u03b8(r) = \u220f e\u2208E(r) \u03b8e.\nOf special interest in this context are edge-centred events \u039b(e) = {r \u2208 RC | e \u2208 e, e \u2208 E(r)}, for e \u2286 E(C) and e = (w, w\u2032) \u2208 e, which collect all atoms in the sample space which pass from position w to w\u2032. Position-centred events \u039b(w) = {r \u2208 RC |w \u2208 w, (\u00b7, w) \u2208 E(r)}, for w \u2282 W, collect all atoms which reached a position w \u2208 w. A CEG is not only very expressive for describing how certain events might unfold, but its graph can also embed formal conditional independences. For a position w \u2208 V(C), let Y(w) be a variable whose state space Y(w) can be identified with the set of w \u2192 w\u221e subpaths. Let Z(w) be a variable whose state space Z(w) can be identified with the set of w1 \u2192 w subpaths, w1 being the root of the CEG. Then, from [46], we have that\nY(w) \u22a5 Z(w) | \u039b(w),\nwhich can be read as \u2018variables defined downstream of w are independent of variables defined upstream, given the event \u039b(w)\u2019.\nJust as for BNs, we can easily express the form of the interpolating polynomial of a CEG model as follows:\nLemma 2. The interpolating polynomial of a CEG can be written as cC(\u03b8) = \u2211 r\u2208RC \u03c0\u03b8(r) = \u2211 r\u2208RC \u220f e\u2208E(r) \u03b8e.\nIn [22] we introduced the CEG network polynomial and showed that its derivatives can be used to answer various inferential queries. We extensively discussed there the advantages of the symbolic representation of CEGs over the one of BNs: for instance, the network polynomial of the CEG has most often less terms and terms of lower degree than the one of the associated BN representation. For a more extensive comparison of the two polynomial forms see [22].\nExample 5. Letting \u03b8i j denote the primitive probability associated to j-th emanating edge from position wi as shown in Figure 4, the interpolating polynomial of the CEG in Figure 4 equals, by Lemma 2,\ncC(\u03b8) = \u03b811\u03b821\u03b851 + \u03b811\u03b821\u03b852 + \u03b811\u03b822\u03b861 + \u03b811\u03b822\u03b862 + \u03b812\u03b841\u03b851 + \u03b812\u03b841\u03b852+ \u03b812\u03b842\u03b861 + \u03b812\u03b842\u03b852 + \u03b813\u03b831\u03b861 + \u03b813\u03b831\u03b862 + \u03b813\u03b832\u03b871 + \u03b813\u03b832\u03b872. (3)\nAlthough many CEGs have an associated multilinear polynomial, as the one in Example 5, this does not necessarily need to be the case. The notion of stages gives enough flexibility to build models with non-multilinear interpolating polynomials. This happens whenever two positions in the same stage are along the same path.\nDefinition 11. A CEG with multilinear interpolating polynomial is said to be square-free [23].\n2.3. Non-multilinear models Having discussed multilinear models, we now introduce more general structures which are often encountered in dynamic settings. Although many more models have this property, for instance dynamic chain graphs [2] and dynamic chain event graphs [4], for the purposes of this paper we focus here on two important model classes: dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) [33] and non-square-free CEGs.\n2.3.1. Dynamic Bayesian networks DBNs extend the BN framework to dynamic and stochastic domains. As often in practice, we consider only stationary, feed-forward DBNs respecting the first order Markov assumption with a finite horizon T \u2208 N, see e.g. [27]. This assumes that probabilities do not vary when shifted on time (stationarity), that current states only depend on the previous time point (first-order Markov assumption) and that contemporaneous variable cannot directly affect each other (feed-forward). These DBNs can be simply described by an initial distribution over the first time point and a BN having as vertex set two generic time slices. Such latter BN is usually called 2-Time slice Bayesian Network (2-TBN). Let {Y(t)}t\u2208[T ] = {Yi(t) : i \u2208 [m]}t\u2208[T ] be a time series. Definition 12. A 2-TBN for {Y(t)}t\u2208[T ] is a BN with DAG G such that V(G) = {Yi(t), Yi(t + 1) : i \u2208 [m]}, any vertex Yi(t) has no parents and there are no edges (Yi(r), Y j(r)), i, j \u2208 [m], r = t, t + 1, t \u2208 [T \u2212 1].\nDefinition 13. A DBN for the time series {Y(t)}t\u2208[T ] is a pair (G,G\u2032), such that G is a BN with vertex set V(G) = {Yi(1) : i \u2208 [m]}, and G\u2032 is a 2-TBN such that its vertex set V(G\u2032) is equal to {Yi(t), Yi(t + 1) : i \u2208 [m]}.\nExample 6. Consider the problem of Example 1 and suppose the newborn can acquire the disease once a year. Suppose further that the screening test and the vaccine are available for kids up to three years old. This scenario can be modeled by a DBN with time horizon T = 3, where Yi(t), i, t \u2208 [3], corresponds to the variable Yi of Example 1 measured in the t-th year. Suppose that the probabilities of parents choosing the screening test and vaccination depend on whether or not the newborn acquired the disease in the previous year only. Furthermore, there is evidence that kids have a higher chance of contracting the disease if they were sick the previous year, whilst a lower chance if vaccination was chosen. This situation can be described by the DBN in Figure 5 where at time t = 1 the correlation structure of the non-dynamic problem is assumed.\nFor a finite time horizon T = 3, the sample space has 33 \u00b7 26 atoms and therefore the interpolating polynomial has 972 monomials each of degree 9. To show that this polynomial is not multilinear, consider the event that every year parents choose to both screen and vaccinate the newborn and that she got sick in her first year of life, denoted as yT = (Y1(t) = 2, Y2(1) = 1, Y3(t) = 1, t \u2208 [3]). Let the parameters for the first time slice be denoted as in Example 1 and denote for t = 2, 3\n\u03b8\u03021i2 j = Pr(Y1(t) = i | Y2(t \u2212 1) = j), i = 0, 1, 2, j = 0, 1, \u03b8\u03022i2 j3k = Pr(Y2(t) = i | Y2(t \u2212 1) = j, Y3(t \u2212 1) = k), i, j, k = 0, 1, \u03b8\u03023i2 j = Pr(Y3(t) = i | Y2(t \u2212 1) = j), i, j = 0, 1.\nThe interpolating polynomial for this event equals cDBN(\u03b8, yT ) = \u03b8312111\u03b82111\u03b811 ( \u03b8\u030213122 \u03b8\u0302 2 1121 (\u03b8\u0302 2 212131 + \u03b8\u0302202131 \u03b8\u0302212131 ) + \u03b8\u03023120 \u03b8\u03023121 \u03b8\u03021121 \u03b8\u03021120 \u03b8\u0302202131 (\u03b8\u0302202031 + \u03b8\u0302212031 ) ) ,\nwhich has indeterminates of degree 2 and therefore is not multilinear.\nNote that in the example above indeterminates can have degree up to to T \u22121, since this corresponds to the longest length of a path where the visited vertices can have probabilities that are identified in the \u2018unrolled\u2019 version of the DBN, i.e. one where the 2-TBN graph for time t is recursively collated to the one of time t \u2212 1. From this observation the following follows.\nProposition 2. A DBN is a parametric model with monomial parametrisation, whose interpolating polynomial is homogeneous and each indeterminate can have degree lower or equal to T \u2212 1.\n2.3.2. Non square-free chain event graphs As noticed in Section 2.2.3, the stage structure of a tree allows for enough flexibility to depict models whose interpolating polynomial is not multilinear, as shown by the following example.\nExample 7. Consider again the situation in Example 1 and suppose now that the parents have the possibility of repeating the screening test up to three times in the first year of life of the newborn if all the previous results are inconclusive. We also assume that the probabilities of acquiring the disease for positive/negative screening results are the same after any screening attempt. For simplicity, we now drop the vaccination decision. The above problem can be depicted by the CEG in Figure 6, where up to three positions in the same stage can be along the same path. Its interpolating polynomial equals\n\u03b8312(\u03b851 + \u03b852) + (\u03b8 2 12 + \u03b812)(\u03b811\u03b841 + \u03b811\u03b842 + \u03b813\u03b861 + \u03b813\u03b862) + \u03b811(\u03b841 + \u03b842) + \u03b813(\u03b861 + \u03b862). (4)\nThe interpolating polynomial in equation (4) is not only non-multilinear, but also non-homogeneous, i.e. its monomials do not have all the same degree. This is a typical feature of tree models [22]."}, {"heading": "3. Sensitivity analysis in multilinear models", "text": "We can now formalize sensitivity analysis techniques for multilinear parametric models. We focus mainly on one-way sensitivity methods. Although some preliminary work on multi-way analyses is now available [5, 10], the computational cost of such investigations have limited their use in practice. However, in Section 6 we present some novel results for this type of analyses. We now demonstrate that all the results about one-way sensitivity analysis in BN models straightforwardly extend to multilinear parametric models and therefore hold under much weaker assumptions about the structure of both the sample space and the underlying conditional independences.\n3.1. Covariation In one-way analyses one parameter within a parametrisation of a model is varied. When this is done, then some of the remaining parameters need to be varied as well to respect the sum-to-one condition, so that the resulting measure is a probability measure. In the binary case this is straightforward, since the second parameter will be equal to one minus the other. But in generic discrete finite cases there are various considerations the user needs to take into account, as reviewed below.\nLet \u03b8i \u2208 \u0398 be the parameter varied to \u03b8\u0303i and suppose this is associated to a random variable YC in the random vector Y. Let \u0398C = {\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8i, . . . , \u03b8r} \u2286 \u0398 be the subset of the parameter set including \u03b8i describing the probability distribution of YC and whose elements need to respect the sum to one condition. For instance \u0398C would include the entries of a CPT for a fixed combination of the parent variables in a BN model or the floret parameters in a CEG. Suppose further these parameters are indexed according to their values, i.e. \u03b81 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03b8i \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03b8r. From [41] we then have the following definition.\nDefinition 14. Let \u03b8i \u2208 \u0398C be varied to \u03b8\u0303i. A covariation scheme \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) : [0, 1]2 \u2192 [0, 1] is a function that takes as input the value of both \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C and returns an updated value for \u03b8 j denoted as \u03b8\u0303 j.\nDifferent covariation schemes may entertain different properties which, depending on the domain of application, might be more or less desirable. We now list some of these properties from [41].\nDefinition 15. In the notation of Definition 14, we say that a covariation scheme \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) is \u2022 valid, if \u2211 j\u2208[r] \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = 1; \u2022 impossibility preserving, if for any parameter \u03b8 j = 0, j , i, we have that \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = 0;\n\u2022 order preserving, if \u03c3(\u03b81, \u03b8\u0303i) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03c3(\u03b8r, \u03b8\u0303i);\n\u2022 identity preserving, if \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8i) = \u03b8 j, \u2200 j \u2208 [r];\n\u2022 linear, if \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = \u03b3 j\u03b8\u0303i + \u03b4 j, for \u03b3 j \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03b4 j \u2208 (\u22121, 1). Of course any covariation scheme needs to be valid, otherwise the resulting measure is not a probability measure and any inference from the model would be misleading. Applying a linear scheme is very natural: if for instance \u03b3 j = \u03b4 j, then \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = \u03b3 j(1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i) and the scheme assigns a proportion \u03b3 j of the remaining probability mass 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i to the remaining parameters. Following [41] we now introduce a number of frequently applied covariation schemes.\nDefinition 16. In the notation of Definition 14, we define\n\u2022 the proportional covariation scheme, \u03c3pro(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i), as \u03c3pro(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) =  \u03b8\u0303i, if j = i,1\u2212\u03b8\u0303i\n1\u2212\u03b8i \u03b8 j, otherwise.\n\u2022 the uniform covariation scheme, \u03c3uni(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i), for r = #\u0398C , as \u03c3uni(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = { \u03b8\u0303i, if j = i, 1\u2212\u03b8\u0303i r\u22121 , otherwise.\n\u2022 the order preserving covariation scheme, \u03c3ord(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i), for i , r, as\n\u03c3ord(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) =  \u03b8\u0303i, if j = i, \u03b8 j \u03b8i \u03b8\u0303i, if j < i and \u03b8\u0303i \u2264 \u03b8i, \u2212\u03b8 j(1\u2212\u03b8suc) \u03b8suc\u03b8i \u03b8\u0303i + \u03b8 j \u03b8suc , if j > i and \u03b8\u0303i \u2264 \u03b8i, \u03b8 j\n\u03b8max\u2212\u03b8i (\u03b8max \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i), if j < i and \u03b8\u0303i > \u03b8i, \u03b8 j\u2212\u03b8max \u03b8max\u2212\u03b8i (\u03b8max \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i) + \u03b8max, if j > i and \u03b8\u0303i > \u03b8i,\nwhere \u03b8max = 1/(1 + r \u2212 i) is the upper bound for \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8suc = \u2211r\nk=i+1 \u03b8k is the original mass of the parameters succeeding \u03b8i in the ordering.\nTable 1 summarizes which of the properties introduced in Definition 15 the above schemes entertain (see [41] for more details). Under proportional covariation, to all the covarying parameters is assigned the same proportion of the remaining probability mass as these originally had. Although this scheme is not order preserving, it maintains the order among the covarying parameters. The uniform scheme on the other hand gives the same amount of the remaining mass to all covarying parameters. In addition, although the order preserving scheme is the only one that entertains the order preserving property, this limits the possible variations allowed. Furthermore, in this scheme the last and biggest parameter \u03b8r cannot be varied: however this is not a very limiting constraint since we can always write one parameter as one minus the sum of the others. Note that this scheme is not only simply linear, but more precisely piece-wise linear, i.e. a function composed of straight-line sections.\nAll the schemes in Definition 16 are domain independent and therefore can be applied with no prior knowledge about the application of interest. Other schemes, for instance domain dependent or non-linear, have been defined, but these are not of interest for the theory we develop here.\n3.2. Sensitivity functions Sensitivity functions describe the effect of varying one parameter on the probability of an event YT \u2286 Y of interest. A sensitivity function fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) equals the probability Pr(Y \u2208 YT ) , p\u03b8(yT ) and is a function in \u03b8\u0303i, where \u03b8i is varied to \u03b8\u0303i. Our parametric definition of a statistical model enables us to explicitly express these as functions of the covariation scheme for any multilinear model. Recall that A = {\u03b1y | y \u2208 Y} and let T = {\u03b1y | y \u2208 YT }. Let AC ,TC \u2282 {0, 1}k be the subsets of A and T respectively including the exponents where the entry associated to an indeterminate in \u0398C is not zero, AC j \u2286 AC and TC j \u2286 TC the subsets including the exponents such that the entry relative to \u03b8 j is not zero. Formally\nAC = {\u03b1y | y \u2208 Y,\u03b1y, j , 0, j \u2208 [r]}, TC = {\u03b1y | y \u2208 YT ,\u03b1y, j , 0, j \u2208 [r]}, AC j = {\u03b1y | y \u2208 Y,\u03b1y, j , 0}, TC j = {\u03b1y | y \u2208 YT ,\u03b1y, j , 0}.\nLet AC\u2212 j ,TC\u2212 j \u2286 {0, 1}k\u22121 be the sets including the elements in AC j and TC j , respectively, where the entry relative to \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C is deleted. Lastly, let \u03b8\u2212 j = \u220f \u03b8l\u2208\u0398\\{\u03b8 j} \u03b8l.\nTheorem 1. Let P\u03a8 be a multilinear parametric model, where the parameter \u03b8i \u2208 \u0398C is varied to \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\ {\u03b8i} is covaried according to a valid scheme \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i), j \u2208 [r] \\ {i}. The sensitivity function fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) can be written as\nfyT (\u03b8\u0303i) = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i\u03b8\u0303i + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) + \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1. (5)\nProof. p\u03b8(yT ) = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T \u03b8\u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC \u03b8\u03b1 + \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1 = \u2211 j\u2208[r] \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03b8 j + \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i\u03b8i + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03b8 j + \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1.\nNoting that fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) = p\u03b8(yT ) and substituting \u03b8i with \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\ {\u03b8i} with \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i), the result easily follows.\nFrom Theorem 1 we can deduce that for a multilinear model, under a linear covariation scheme, the sensitivity function is linear.\nCorollary 1. Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the sensitivity function, fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) under a linear covariation scheme \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = \u03b3 j\u03b8\u0303i + \u03b4 j equals\nfyT (\u03b8\u0303i) = \u03b1\u03b8\u0303i + \u03b2, (6)\nwhere \u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03b3 j, \u03b2 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1 + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03b4 j. (7)\nProof. The result follows by substituting the definition of a linear covariation scheme into equation (5) and then rearranging.\nTherefore, under a linear covariation scheme, the sensitivity function is a linear function of the varying parameter \u03b8\u0303i. This was long known for BN models [8, 21, 41]. However, we have proven here that this feature is shared amongst all models having a multilinear interpolating polynomial. In BNs the computation of the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 is particularly fast since for these models computationally efficient propagation techniques have been established. But these exist, sometimes less efficiently, for other models as well (see e.g. [44] for CEGs and staged trees). Within our symbolic definition, we note however that once the exponent sets TC\u2212 j , j \u2208 [r], are identified, then one can simply plug-in the values of the indeterminates to compute these coefficients.\nExample 8. Consider a generic BN with m vertices and recall that the sample space of one random variable is Yi = {0, . . . , mi}, i \u2208 [m]. Suppose \u03b8ik\u03c0, the k-th entry of the distribution associated to a vertex Yi given configuration \u03c0 of its parents, k \u2264 mi, is varied to \u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0 and \u03c3(\u03b8i j\u03c0, \u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0) = \u03b3i j \u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0 + \u03b4i j is the covariation scheme for the parameters in the same CPT, j \u2264 mi . Then the sensitivity function of an event (YT = yT ), yT \u2208 YT , T \u2286 [m], has been shown in [41] to be equal to\nfyT (\u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0) = \u03b1ik + \u2211 j\u2208Yi\\{k} \u03b1i j\u03b3i j  \u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0 + \u03b2 + \u2211 j\u2208Yi\\{k} \u03b1i j\u03b4i j  , (8) where \u03b1i j = Pr(YT = yT |Yi = j, Y\u03a0i = \u03c0), j \u2208 {0, . . . , mi}, and \u03b2 = Pr(YT = yT , Y\u03a0i , \u03c0). Thus equation (8) is a special case of the sensitivity function of a multilinear model of Theorem 1.\nWe now deduce the sensitivity function when parameters are varied using the popular proportional scheme.\nCorollary 2. Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the sensitivity function, fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) under a proportional covariation scheme \u03c3pro(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = 1\u2212\u03b8\u0303i1\u2212\u03b8i \u03b8 j can be written in the linear form of equation (6), where\n\u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC j \u03b8\u03b1 1 \u2212 \u03b8i , \u03b2 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1 + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC j \u03b8\u03b1 1 \u2212 \u03b8i .\nProof. For a proportional scheme the coefficients in the definition of a linear scheme equals \u03b3 j = \u2212\u03b8 j/(1 \u2212 \u03b8i) and \u03b4 j = \u03b8 j/(1 \u2212 \u03b8i). By substituting these expressions into equation (7) we have that\n\u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j \u03b8 j 1 \u2212 \u03b8i , \u03b2 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1 + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j \u03b8 j 1 \u2212 \u03b8i .\nPlugging in these coefficients in equation (6) then\nfyT (\u03b8\u0303i) =  \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03b8 j 1 \u2212 \u03b8i  \u03b8\u0303i +  \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1 + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03b8 j 1 \u2212 \u03b8i  =\n \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC\u2212i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC j \u03b8\u03b1 1 \u2212 \u03b8i  \u03b8\u0303i +  \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\TC \u03b8\u03b1 + \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208TC j \u03b8\u03b1 1 \u2212 \u03b8i  . It is often of interest to investigate the posterior probability of a target event (Y \u2208 YT ) given that an event (Y \u2208 YO) has been observed, YT ,YO \u2286 Y. This can be represented by the posterior sensitivity function f yOyT (\u03b8\u0303i) describing the probability Pr(Y \u2208 YT |Y \u2208 YO) as a function of a varying parameter \u03b8\u0303i.\nCorollary 3. Under the conditions of Corollary 1, a posterior sensitivity function f yOyT (\u03b8\u0303i) can be written as the ratio\nf yOyT (\u03b8\u0303i) = \u03b11\u03b8\u0303i + \u03b21\n\u03b12\u03b8\u0303i + \u03b22 , (9)\nwhere \u03b11,\u03b12 \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03b21, \u03b22 \u2208 (\u22121, 1).\nProof. The result follows from equation (6) and by noting that Pr(Y \u2208 YT |Y \u2208 YO) = Pr(Y \u2208 {YT \u2229 YO})/Pr(Y \u2208 YO).\nThe form of the coefficients in Corollary 3 can be deduced by simply adapting the notation of equation (5) to the events Pr(Y \u2208 {YT \u2229 YO}) and Pr(Y \u2208 YO) for the numerator and the denominator, respectively, of equation (9). Sensitivity functions describing posterior probabilities in BNs have been proven to entertain the form in equation (9). Again, Corollary 3 shows that this is so for any model having a multilinear interpolating polynomial.\n3.3. The Chan-Darwiche distance Whilst sensitivity functions study local changes, CD distances describe global changes in distributions [11]. These can be used to study by how much two vectors of atomic probabilities vary in their distributional assumptions if one arises from the other via a covariation scheme. We are then interested in the global impact of that local change. We start by defining the distance.\nDefinition 17. Let p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303 \u2208 P\u03a8 two vectors of values of two probability mass functions from the same parametric model P\u03a8. The CD distance between p\u03b8 and p\u03b8\u0303, CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303), is defined as\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln maxy\u2208Y p\u03b8\u0303(y) p\u03b8(y) \u2212 ln min y\u2208Y p\u03b8\u0303(y) p\u03b8(y) , (10)\nwhere 0/0 is defined as 1.\nAlthough this has not been recognized in the literature yet, we note that the CD distance coincides with the DeRobertis distance, used in robustness studies in Bayesian inference [24, 43]. This has the very convenient property for Bayesian inference of being invariant to Bayesian evidential updating: the distance between two distributions a priori and after both have been updated using some data points does not change. It has also been noted that in sensitivity analysis in BNs, if one parameter of one CPT is varied, then distance between the original and the varied BN equals the distance between the original and the varied CPT [11, 43]. We demonstrate now that this property is more generally entertained by any multilinear model.\nFor a p\u03b8 \u2208 P\u03a8, let pC\u03b8 = (pC\u03b8 (y) | y \u2208 YC), where YC is the sample space of YC , and pC\u03b8 (y) = \u03b8 \u03b1y C , for any y \u2208 YC , with \u03b8C = \u220f\n\u03b8 j\u2208\u0398C \u03b8 j and \u03b1y \u2208 Nr with |\u03b1y| = 1, i.e. the sum of its elements is equal to one. The vector pC\u03b8 is therefore the probability mass function of the parametric model whose atomic probabilities are the elements of \u0398C .\nTheorem 2. Let p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303 \u2208 P\u03a8, where P\u03a8 is a multilinear parametric model and p\u03b8\u0303 arises from p\u03b8 by varying \u03b8i to \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\ {\u03b8i} to \u03b8\u0303 j = \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i), where \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) is a valid covariation scheme, j \u2208 [r] \\ {i}. Then the CD distance between p\u03b8 and p\u03b8\u0303 is equal to\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = CD(p C \u03b8 , p C \u03b8\u0303 ) = ln max j\u2208[r]\n\u03b8\u0303 j \u03b8 j \u2212 ln min j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0303 j \u03b8 j .\nProof. For a multilinear parametric model the CD distance can be written as\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max \u03b1\u2208A\n\u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 \u2212 ln min \u03b1\u2208A \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 = ln max { max \u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 , max \u03b1\u2208A\\AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 } \u2212 ln min { min \u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 , min \u03b1\u2208A\\AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 } .\nIf \u03b1 \u2208 A \\ AC , then \u03b8\u0303 = \u03b8 and thus \u03b8\u0303\u03b1/\u03b8\u03b1 = 1. Because of the validity of the covariation scheme note that max\u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u0303 \u03b1/\u03b8\u03b1 \u2265 1 and min\u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1/\u03b8\u03b1 \u2264 1. Thus\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max \u03b1\u2208AC\n\u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 \u2212 ln min \u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 .\nNow note that \u03b8\u0303 = \u03b8\u2212 j\u03b8\u0303 j, for a \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C , and thus \u03b8\u0303\u03b1/\u03b8\u03b1 = \u03b8\u0303 j/\u03b8 j since \u03b1 \u2208 {0, 1}k. Since there is at least one \u03b1 \u2208 AC such that \u03b1 j , 0, j \u2208 [r], then max\u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1/\u03b8\u03b1 = max j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0303 j/\u03b8 j and min\u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u0303\u03b1/\u03b8\u03b1 = min j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0303 j/\u03b8 j. Consequently CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = CD(pC\u03b8 , p C \u03b8\u0303 ).\nExample 9. Suppose the parameter \u03b8ik\u03c0 associated to the vertex Yi of a BN model for a fixed configuration \u03c0 of the parents is varied to \u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0. Then, in [11] it is shown that the distance can be written as\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max k\u2208Yi\n\u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0 \u03b8ik\u03c0 \u2212 ln min k\u2208Yi \u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0 \u03b8ik\u03c0 .\nThis is simply an instance of Theorem 2, since the distance depends only on the parameters of one CPT of one vertex for a specific configuration of the parents.\nJust as [41] we can also express the distance as an explicit function of the covariation scheme. This will be very useful for deducing closed-form expressions for the CD distances under specific covariation schemes.\nCorollary 4. Under the conditions of Theorem 2, we can write CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max { \u03b8\u0303i \u03b8i , max j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) \u03b8 j } \u2212 ln min { \u03b8\u0303i \u03b8i , min j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) \u03b8 j } .\nProof. This follows by substituting \u03b8\u0303 j with the covariation scheme in equation (10) to the covaried parameters.\nA key result in sensitivity analysis for BNs shows that the CD distance is minimized when parameters are varied according to a proportional scheme [11]. This is important since a parameter might be varied to change an uncalibrated probability of interest, but a user might want to achieve this by choosing a distribution as close as possible to the original one. This has given a strong theoretical justification to the large use of such a scheme. It is straightforward to show that for generic multilinear models this is also true.\nCorollary 5. Under the conditions of Theorem 2, the CD distance is minimized by a proportional covariation scheme and can be written in closed form as\nCDpro(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223ln \u03b8\u0303i\u03b8i \u2212 ln 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i1 \u2212 \u03b8i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . Proof. The optimality result follows by noting that the parameters in \u0398C define a discrete probability measure, which can be thought of as a CPT of one vertex of a BN given a configuration of the parent variables. Therefore, since the distance is minimized for BNs it is also the case for multilinear models. More formally let \u03b8\u0304i = \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8\u0304 j, j \u2208 [r] \\ {i}, be values obtained via a valid covariation scheme \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0304i). We want to prove that CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0304) \u2265 CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303), where p\u03b8\u0303 is the mass function for a proportional covariation.\nFirst note that if either \u03b8i = 0 or \u03b8i = 1 then the distance is infinite under both covariation schemes and the result holds. Consider now \u03b8i \u2208 (0, 1) and suppose \u03b8\u0304i = \u03b8\u0303i > \u03b8i. Under a proportional scheme, we have that\nmax j\u2208[r]\n\u03b8\u0303 j \u03b8 j = \u03b8\u0303i \u03b8i and min j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0303 j \u03b8 j = \u03b8 j(1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i) (\u03b8 j(1 \u2212 \u03b8i)) = (1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i) (1 \u2212 \u03b8i) .\nConversely, for the generic covariation scheme \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0304i) we have that\n1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0304i 1 \u2212 \u03b8i\n= \u2211\nj\u2208[r]\\{i}\n\u03b8\u0304 j \u03b8 j = \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u03b8 j(\u03b8\u0304 j/\u03b8 j) \u03b8 j \u2265 \u2211 j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u03b8 j(mink\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0304k/\u03b8k) \u03b8 j = min k\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0304k \u03b8k .\nThus since (1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0304i)/(1 \u2212 \u03b8i) = (1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i)/(1 \u2212 \u03b8i) we have that min j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0303i/\u03b8i \u2265 min j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0304i/\u03b8i. Furthermore,\nmax j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0304i \u03b8i \u2265 \u03b8\u0304i \u03b8i = \u03b8\u0303i \u03b8i = max j\u2208[r] \u03b8\u0303 j \u03b8 j .\nIt then follows that CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0304) \u2265 CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) when \u03b8\u0303i > \u03b8i. For the case \u03b8\u0303i < \u03b8i the proof mirrors the one presented here. The explicit form of the distance under the proportional scheme follows by noting that the maximum and the minimum can either be \u03b8\u0303i/\u03b8i or (1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i)/(1 \u2212 \u03b8i).\nGiven the explicit expression of the CD distance in terms of the covariation scheme in Corollary 4, it is then possible to write in closed form the distance for the covariation schemes in Definition 16. As an example, for a \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) = \u03b3 j(1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303 j) we have that\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u0303\u03b8) = ln max  \u03b8\u0303i\u03b8i , 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i(r \u2212 1) min j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u03b3\u22121j \u03b8 j  \u2212 ln min  \u03b8\u0303i\u03b8i , 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i(r \u2212 1) max j\u2208[r]\\{i} \u03b3\u22121j \u03b8 j  .\nFor other covariation schemes, closed form formulas can be simply deduced by adapting the notation of [41].\n3.4. Kullback-Leibler divergence Although the CD distance is widely used in sensitivity analyses, comparisons between two distributions are usually performed by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence [29].\nDefinition 18. Let p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303 \u2208 P\u03a8 two vectors of values of two probability mass functions from the same parametric model P\u03a8. The KL distance between p\u03b8 and p\u03b8\u0303, KL(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303), is defined as\nKL(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = \u2212 \u2211 y\u2208Y p\u03b8(y) ln ( p\u03b8\u0303(y) p\u03b8(y) ) . (11)\nRecall that KL is not formally a distance, since it is not symmetric [11]. The following proposition formalizes the form of the KL divergence for multilinear parametric models when one parameter is varied.\nProposition 3. The KL divergence between p\u03b8 and p\u03b8\u0303 for a multilinear parametric model P\u03a8 when the parameter \u03b8i is varied to \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\ {\u03b8i} is covaried according to a valid covariation scheme to \u03b8\u0303 j, j \u2208 [r] \\ {i}, equals\nKL(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = KL(p C \u03b8 , p C \u03b8\u0303 ) \u2211 j\u2208[r] \u2211 \u03b1\u2208AC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j.\nProof. For a multilinear parametric model the KL distance can be written as\nKL(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = \u2212 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A \u03b8\u03b1 ln ( \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 ) = \u2212 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u03b1 ln ( \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 ) \u2212 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A\\AC \u03b8\u03b1 ln ( \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 ) Since \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 = \u03b8\u03b1 if \u03b1 \u2208 A \\ AC , then ln(\u03b8\u0303\u03b1/\u03b8\u03b1) = 0. Therefore\nKL(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = \u2212 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208AC \u03b8\u03b1 ln ( \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 ) = \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208[r] \u2211 \u03b1\u2208AC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j\u03b8 j ln ( \u03b8\u0303 j \u03b8 j ) = \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208[r] \u03b8 j ln ( \u03b8\u0303 j \u03b8 j ) \u2211 \u03b1\u2208AC\u2212 j \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j,\nand the result follows from Definition 18 of the KL distance.\nTherefore the KL divergence does not necessarily respect the local separability property of CD distances not only for BN models [11], but also for any multilinear model. This means that one way sensitivity analyses based on KL distances can become computationally infeasible, since the constant term in equation (11) might need to be computed an arbitrary number of times. This observation has lead to a widespread use of CD distances in sensitivity analysis.\nExample 10. Suppose the parameter \u03b8ik\u03c0 associated to the vertex Yi of a BN model for a fixed configuration \u03c0 of the parents is varied to \u03b8\u0303ik\u03c0. The KL divergence between the two mass functions can be shown to be equal to\nKL(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = p\u03b8(\u03c0)KL(p i\u03c0 \u03b8 , p i\u03c0 \u03b8\u0303 ),\nwhere pi\u03c0\u03b8 and p i\u03c0 \u03b8\u0303 are, respectively, the original and the varied probability mass function of the CPT including \u03b8ik\u03c0.\nWhen using KL divergences in sensitivity analyses great care needs to be taken. For instance, [11] showed that two distributions might have KL divergence equal to zero whilst quantities of interest for inferential queries, e.g. odds ratios, can be arbitrarly close to some constant k.\n\u03b811 = 0.3 \u03b812 = 0.2 \u03b821 = 0.4 \u03b832 = 0.6 \u03b841 = 0.1 \u03b851 = 0.6 \u03b861 = 0.9 \u03b871 = 0.3\nTable 2: Specification of the probabilities of the CEG in Figure 4."}, {"heading": "4. Sensitivity analysis in square-free CEGs", "text": "The previous section has formalized sensitivity methods in multilinear parametric models and shown that these generalize the results for BN models. As an illustration of these techniques to a different multilinear model we now consider the class of CEGs. Whilst in multilinear models the sum-to-one condition needs to be respected in the sets \u0398C and in BNs this needs to hold for CPTs, in CEG models (conditional) probability distributions are associated to its florets: probabilities associated to edges emanating from the same position must sum to one. So when varying one parameter from one floret, not only the parameters associated to emanating edges from the same position needs to covary, but also those of edges from positions in the same stage. Formally, for an edge ei \u2208 E(C), let ei be the set of edges whose primitive probabilities are identified with \u03b8ei and wei the set of positions w such that for every e \u2208 ei, e = (w, \u00b7). Suppose each element of wei has si emanating edges labeled e j, j \u2208 [si], and let w\u0304ei be the complement of wei in W.\n4.1. Sensitivity functions for square-free CEGs\nSuppose we are interested in the probability of an event A associated to a set of root-to-leaf paths RA as a function of \u03b8\u0303ei , the varied version of \u03b8ei .\nCorollary 6. For a square-free CEG, the sensitivity function fA(\u03b8\u0303ei ) when \u03b8ei is varied and the parameters \u03b8e j in the same floret F (wei , \u00b7) are covaried according to a valid scheme \u03c3(\u03b8e j , \u03b8\u0303ei ) is\nfA(\u03b8\u0303ei ) = \u03b1\u03b8\u0303ei + \u2211\nj\u2208[si]\\{i} \u03b2 j\u03c3(\u03b8e j , \u03b8\u0303ei ) + , (12)\nwhere \u03b1 = Pr(A | \u039b(ei)) Pr(\u039b(wei )), \u03b2 j = Pr(A | \u039b(e j)) Pr(\u039b(we j )), = Pr(A, \u039b(w\u0304ei )). (13)\nProof. By the law of total probability recall that Pr(A) = Pr(A, \u039b(wei )) + Pr(A, \u039b(w\u0304ei )). For the second term, using again the law of total probability together with the chain rule for probabilities, we can deduce that\nPr(A, \u039b(w\u0304ei ))= \u2211\nj\u2208[si]\\{i} Pr(A|\u039b(e j), \u039b(we j )) Pr(\u039b(e j)|\u039b(we j )) Pr(\u039b(we j )) + Pr(A|\u039b(ei), \u039b(wei )) Pr(\u039b(ei)|\u039b(wei )) Pr(\u039b(wei )).\nUsing the conditional independence statements implied by the CEG and applying \u03c3(\u03b8e j , \u03b8ei ) we then have\nfA(\u03b8\u0303ei ) = Pr(A, \u039b(w\u0304ei )) + \u2211\nj\u2208[si]\\{i} Pr(A |\u039b(e j)) Pr(\u039b(we j ))\u03c3(\u03b8e j , \u03b8\u0303ei ) + Pr(A |\u039b(ei)) Pr(\u039b(wei ))\u03b8\u0303ei .\nThe coefficients in equation (13) can be efficiently computed either through propagation techniques [44] or by differentiation of the network polynomial [22]. These probabilities can also be visually deduced from the underlying graph of the CEG since its root-to-leaf paths coincide with the model\u2019s sample space. We illustrate the intuitiveness of these operations in CEGs with the following example.\nExample 11. Suppose the definition of the CEG in Figure 4 is completed with the probability specifications in Table 2. Suppose we are interested in the event that the newborn is healthy as a function of an inconclusive screening test. This event is described by the root-to-leaf paths going through an edge labeled \u2018healthy\u2019 and the sets ei and wei include one element only: (w1, w2) and w1 respectively. Furthermore the floret associated to w1 has two other emanating edges (w1, w3) and (w1, w4) whose associated probabilities need to covary.\nTo compute the sensitivity function we need to derive the probabilities in the coefficients in equation (13). Note that = 0 since there are no paths not going through w1, the root of the CEG. This also implies Pr(\u039b(wei )) = 1. Lastly, the probabilities Pr(A | \u039b(e j)), j \u2208 [si], correspond to \u03b8kl, k = 2, 3, 4, l = 1, 2, the probability that the newborn is healthy once position wk is reached. Thus\nfA(\u03b8\u030312) = \u03b821\u03b8\u030311 + \u03b841\u03c3(\u03b812, \u03b8\u030311) + \u03b832\u03c3(\u03b813, \u03b8\u030311).\nThe form of the sensitivity function under different covariation schemes is shown in Figure 7. We can notice that the choice of this scheme has a significant impact on the probability of interest. Whilst the sensitivity function is increasing for a proportional scheme, it is decreasing for the uniform one. Under an order preserving scheme the behavior of the sensitivity function is decreasing in (0, 0.3), the original value of the varied parameter, and then increasing in (0.3, 0.5), where 0.5 is the maximum value \u03b811 can take for the scheme to be valid. All these functions, because square-free CEGs are multilinear models, are (piece-wise) linear as specified by Theorem 1.\nWhen the covariation scheme is linear then also the sensitivity function of a square-free CEG is linear, as specified in Corollary 1.\nCorollary 7. Under the conditions of Corollary 6, suppose \u03c3(\u03b8e j , \u03b8\u0303ei ) = \u03b3 j\u03b8\u0303ei + \u03b4 j, for j \u2208 [si] \\ {i}. Then\nfA(x) = \u03b1 + \u2211 j\u2208[si]\\{i} \u03b2 j\u03b3 j  \u03b8\u0303ei +  \u2211 j\u2208[si]\\{i} \u03b2 j\u03b4 j +  , where \u03b1, \u03b2 j and are defined in equation (13).\nProof. This follows by substituting the definition of a linear covariation scheme into equation (12).\nInterestingly, for non-squared CEGs the posterior sensitivity function conditional on events of the form \u039b(w), indicating that a certain position has been reached, is not rational but again a simple linear function. This is because this conditional probability can be computed from the induced subgraph of the CEG having as root the position w. This subgraph is again a CEG. Since probabilities over this subgraph are multilinear, then sensitivity functions will be linear.\nExample 12. Suppose we are interested in the probability that the newborn is healthy knowing that the screening test result was inconclusive. This probability can be computed from the subgraph of the CEG in Figure 4 having as root w2 and edges along paths between w2 and w\u221e. This probability is then simply \u03b821.\n4.2. CD distance for square-free CEGs\nGiven the derivation of the CD distance for multilinear models, it is straightforward to deduce its explicit form for CEGs, where one parameter \u03b8ei is varied and the floret parameters \u03b8e j are covaried with a valid scheme, j \u2208 [si] \\ {i}.\nCorollary 8. The CD distance for a square-free CEG when \u03b8ei is varied to \u03b8\u0303ei and \u03b8e j is covaried to \u03b8\u0303e j , j \u2208 [si] \\ {i}, according to a valid covariation scheme is given by the distance between the versions of the two floret distributions as\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = CD(p wei \u03b8 , p wei \u03b8\u0303\n) = ln max j\u2208[si]\n\u03b8\u0303e j \u03b8e j \u2212 ln min j\u2208[si] \u03b8\u0303e j \u03b8e j , (14)\nwhere pwei\u03b8 and p wei \u03b8\u0303\nare, respectively, the original and the varied probability mass function of the parametric model defined over the floret with position wei .\nProof. This follows by noting that the set \u0398C of Theorem 2 coincides with the set of parameters associated to edges emanating from position wei .\nHaving deduced the generic form of the CD distance for a square-free CEG, we can now explicitly show its dependence on the covariation scheme.\nCorollary 9. Under the conditions of Theorem 8,\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max  \u03b8\u0303ei\u03b8ei , maxj\u2208[si]\\{i} \u03c3(\u03b8e j , \u03b8\u0303ei )\u03b8e j  \u2212 ln min  \u03b8\u0303ei\u03b8ei , minj\u2208[si]\\{i} \u03c3(\u03b8e j , \u03b8\u0303ei )\u03b8e j  .\nProof. This follows by plugging-in the definition of a covariation scheme into equation (14).\nThe CD distance under specific covariation schemes for CEGs can be deduced by adapting the notation of [41] to the one of CEGs. An illustration of the computation of the CD distance in CEG models can be found in Section 5.2 below."}, {"heading": "5. Sensitivity analysis in non-multilinear models", "text": "For multilinear models we have been able to provide a unifying framework to perform various sensitivity analyses by deducing closed forms for both sensitivity functions and the CD distance. Unfortunately, this is not possible for non-multilinear parametric models because these will depend on the degree of both the indeterminate to be varied and the covaried parameters, which is not necessarily equal to one. However, representing the model through its interpolating polynomial will enable us to study central properties of both sensitivity functions and CD distances. As in Section 3, we let \u03b8i \u2208 \u0398C be varied to \u03b8\u0303i, where \u0398C = {\u03b8 j : j \u2208 [r]} is the set of parameters including \u03b8i which need to respect the sum-to-one condition.\n5.1. Sensitivity functions\nAs in Section 3 we let fyT denote a sensitivity function and f yO yT a posterior sensitivity function.\nProposition 4. Consider a parametric model P\u03a8 with monomial parametrisation \u03a8. Let \u03b8i vary to \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\{\u03b8i} covary according to a linear scheme. The sensitivity function fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) is then a polynomial with degree lower or equal to d, where d = max\u03b1\u2208TC , j\u2208[r]{\u03b1 j}. The posterior sensitivity function f yO yT (\u03b8\u0303i) is a rational function whose numerator and denominator are be polynomials again with degree lower or equal to d.\nProof. This follows by noting that under the conditions of the proposition an exponent \u03b1i,y in Definition 3 of monomial parametrisation, for any \u03b1y \u2208 A cannot be larger than d.\nFor CEGs the form of the sensitivity function depends on the underlying graph. This is because each atomic probability in a CEG is associated to a root-to-leaf path and the probability of that atom is equal to the product of the probabilities associated to edges along that path.\n\u03b813 = 0.5 \u03b812 = 0.3 \u03b811 = 0.2 \u03b841 = 0.1 \u03b851 = 0.4 \u03b861 = 0.6\nTable 3: Probability specification for the CEG in Figure 6.\nCorollary 10. For a CEG having at most d positions in the same stage along the same path, the sensitivity function fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) is a polynomial with degree lower or equal to d when parameters are covaried according to a valid linear covariation scheme.\nProof. This follows directly from Proposition 4 since if there are d positions in the same stage along the same path, then the interpolating polynomial has at least one indeterminate in one monomial with exponent d.\nThe specific form of the sensitivity function in non-multilinear models depends both on the form of the interpolating polynomial, on the parameter to be varied and on the parameters that are consequently covaried. Therefore it is not possible to deduce a unique closed form expression since this will explicitly depend on the degree of all the above indeterminates. However, the interpolating polynomial enables us to identify a straightforward procedure to compute fyT (\u03b8\u0303i) as follows:\n1. determine the polynomial cP\u03a8 (\u03b8, yT ) for an event YT ; 2. replace \u03b8i by \u03b8\u0303i; 3. replace \u03b8 j by \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i) for \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\ {\u03b8i}.\nExample 13. Consider the non-square-free CEG in Figure 6 and suppose we are interested in the event A that the newborn is healthy. This probability equals\ncC(\u03b8, A) = \u03b8312\u03b851 + \u03b8 2 12\u03b811\u03b841 + \u03b812\u03b811\u03b841 + \u03b8 2 12\u03b813\u03b861 + \u03b812\u03b813\u03b816 + \u03b811\u03b841 + \u03b813\u03b861,\nsince each of these monomials is associated to a root-to-leaf path going through an edge labeled \u2018healthy\u2019. Suppose we are interested in the effect the probability \u03b812 of having an inconclusive screening test has on the likelihood of the individual being healthy. By substituting the varied parameters in the polynomial above we deduce the sensitivity function fA(\u03b8\u030312) as\n\u03b851\u03b8\u0303 3 12 + (\u03c3(\u03b811, \u03b8\u030312)\u03b841 + \u03c3(\u03b813, \u03b8\u030312)\u03b861)\u03b8\u0303 2 12 + (\u03c3(\u03b811, \u03b8\u030312)\u03b841 + \u03c3(\u03b813, \u03b8\u030312)\u03b861)\u03b8\u030312 + (\u03c3(\u03b811, \u03b8\u030312)\u03b841 + \u03c3(\u03b813, \u03b8\u030312)\u03b861).\nThe sensitivity functions for different covariation schemes are reported in Figure 8 when parameters are assigned the numeric specifications in Table 3. These functions, for each covariation scheme behave similarly to the ones of the associated multilinear problem depicted in Figure 7. The main difference is that, as formalized by Proposition 4, these functions are not linear, but polynomial. Whilst between 0 and 0.4 the probability of a healthy newborn is almost constant under uniform and proportional schemes, this then varies in a non-linear fashion between 0.4 and 1. Again, the order preserving scheme seems to have a critical behavior. In particular for values close to 0.5 the probability of a healthy newborn is much higher than in the associated multilinear problem in Figure 7. Thus, in non-multilinear models, just as in multilinear ones, the choice of the covariation scheme can have a huge impact both on the size and on the characteristics of an output probability of interest.\n5.2. CD distance We next introduce a general procedure to compute the CD distance for parametric models with monomial parametrisation.\nProposition 5. Let p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303 \u2208 P\u03a8, where P\u03a8 is a parametric model with monomial parametrisation. The CD distance between p\u03b8 and p\u03b8\u0303 when \u03b8i is varied to \u03b8\u0303i and \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\ {\u03b8i} is covaried to \u03b8\u0303 j = \u03c3(\u03b8 j, \u03b8\u0303i), j \u2208 [r] \\ {i}, according to a valid covariation scheme can be computed from the interpolating polynomial as follows:\n1. set \u03b8\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 A \\ AC; 2. set \u03b8k = 1, if k < [r], in any monomial \u03b8\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 AC;\n3. call \u03a6 the set of remaining monomials, \u03c6\u03b1 a generic element of \u03a6 and \u03c6\u0303\u03b1 its varied version; 4. set u = max\u03a6 \u03c6\u0303\u03b1/\u03c6\u03b1 and l = min\u03a6 \u03c6\u0303\u03b1/\u03c6\u03b1; 5. compute CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln(u) \u2212 ln(l).\nIt then follows that CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = CD(p\u03c6, p\u03c6\u0303), where p\u03c6 and p\u03c6\u0303 denote respectively the original and the varied probability mass function of the parametric model whose atomic probabilities are the elements of \u03a6.\nProof. In a multilinear parametric model each atom is associated to a monomial \u03b8\u03b1. For all \u03b1 \u2208 A \\ AC , we have that\np\u03b8\u0303(y) p\u03b8(y) = \u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 = 1,\nand there will always be ratios smaller or bigger than one because of the validity of the covariation scheme. Therefore, these monomials have no impact on the distance (step 1). For \u03b1 \u2208 AC , we have that\n\u03b8\u0303\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1 = \u03b8\u0303\u03b1CC \u03b8\u03b1CC , \u03c6\u0303\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 ,\nwhere \u03b8C = \u220f\nj\u2208[r] \u03b8 j and \u03b1C \u2208 Nr0 is the associated exponent vector. Therefore the distance depends only on the monomials computed in steps 2 and 3. The result then follows from the definition of the CD distance.\nExample 14. We illustrate the procedure for computing the CD distance between the original CEG in Figure 6 and the one after the change of \u03b812 to \u03b8\u030312 under a valid covariation scheme. Since all paths go through position w1, i.e. every monomial has an indeterminate from its floret distribution which includes \u03b812, the first step of the procedure retains all monomials associated to this CEG. At the second step the algorithm sets equal to one the indeterminates \u03b8 ji, i = 1, 2 and j = 4, 5, 6, from these monomials. The resulting set \u03a6 is\n\u03a6 = { \u03b8312, \u03b8 2 12\u03b811, \u03b8 2 12\u03b813, \u03b812\u03b811, \u03b812\u03b813, \u03b811, \u03b813 } The algorithm selects the maximum ratio and the minimum ratio between any of these monomials and then use these in the standard formula of the CD distance. In Figure 8 we plot the CD distance as a function of \u03b812 under different covariation schemes. This shows that the distance is the smallest for the proportional covariation scheme. It is wellknown that this is the case for one-way sensitivity analyses in BNs and in Corollary 5 we showed that this is the case for any multilinear model. Unfortunately, this result does not hold for non-multilinear models as shown by the following example.\nExample 15. Consider two random variables Y1 and Y2 and suppose Y1 = Y2 = [3]. Suppose also\n\u03b81i = Pr(Y1 = i) = Pr(Y2 = i |Y1 = j), i \u2208 [3], j \u2208 [2].\nSuppose we let \u03b811 vary and \u03b812 and \u03b813 covary according to a valid scheme. The set \u03a6 of Proposition 5 is then equal {\u03b8211, \u03b811\u03b812, \u03b813, \u03b8212, \u03b811\u03b813, \u03b812\u03b813}. Suppose \u03b811 = 0.33, \u03b812 = 0.33, \u03b813 = 0.34 and let \u03b811 be varied to 0.4. In this situation the CD distance under a proportional scheme is 2.52, whilst under a uniform scheme the distance equals 2.50. For this parameter variation, the uniform scheme would then be preferred to a proportional one if a user wishes to minimize the CD distance. Conversely, if \u03b811 is set to 0.2 the distance is smaller under the proportional scheme (2.89) than under the uniform one (2.92).\nTherefore, whilst for multilinear models the choice of updating probabilities with a proportional covariation scheme can be justified in terms of some \u2018optimality criterion\u2019 based on the minimization of the CD distance, for nonmultilinear models the choice of the covariation scheme becomes critical. Our examples demonstrated that inference can be greatly affected by the chosen covariation scheme and with no theoretical justification to use one over another when using a model that is not multilinear, any model output can be debatable without a convincing rationale for the choice of the covariation scheme.\nWe next deduce a closed form expression for the CD distance under the proportional covariation scheme.\nProposition 6. Under the condition of Proposition 5 and assuming a proportional covariation scheme the CD distance is\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max \u03b1\u2208A\u2212C ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i 1 \u2212 \u03b8i )|\u03b1\u2212i | \u03b8\u0303i\u03b1i \u03b8i \u03b1i \u2212 ln min \u03b1\u2208A\u2212C ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i 1 \u2212 \u03b8i )|\u03b1\u2212i | \u03b8\u0303i\u03b1i \u03b8i \u03b1i , (15)\nwhere A\u2212C \u2208 Nr0 is the set including the exponents in AC where the entries relative to indeterminates not in \u0398C are deleted, \u03b1\u2212i \u2208 Nr\u221210 is an exponent where the entry relative to \u03b8i is deleted and |\u03b1\u2212i| is the sum of its entries. Proof. From Proposition 5 we can write the CD distance as\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max \u03b1\u2208A\u2212C\n\u03c6\u0303\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 ln min \u03b1\u2208A\u2212C \u03c6\u0303\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 .\nRecall that under a proportional scheme an indeterminate \u03b8 j \u2208 \u0398C \\ {\u03b8i} is varied to \u03b8\u0303 j = \u03b8 j(1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i)/(1 \u2212 \u03b8i). We then have that, for any \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6,\n\u03c6\u0303\u03b1 = \u03b8\u0303\u03b1ii \u220f j\u2208[r]\\{i} ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i 1 \u2212 \u03b8i \u03b8 j )\u03b1 j = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i 1 \u2212 \u03b8i )|\u03b1\u2212i | \u03b8\u03b1\u2212i\u2212i \u03b8\u0303 \u03b1i i ,\nand therefore \u03c6\u0303\u03b1\n\u03c6\u03b1 = \u03b8\u0303\u03b1ii \u03b8\u03b1ii ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303i 1 \u2212 \u03b8i )|\u03b1\u2212i | .\nThen, since CD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = CD(p\u03c6, p\u03c6\u0303) by Proposition 5, we deduce the closed form in equation (15) by substituting the above expression into the definition of CD distance.\nExample 16. Consider again the monomial set \u03a6 of Example 14 and assume the parameters \u03b811 and \u03b813 are covaried according to a proportional scheme. From Proposition 6 we can deduce that the CD distance will then depend on the maximum and minimum value in the set of ratios\n\u03a6 =  \u03b8\u0303312\u03b8312 , \u03b8\u0303212 \u03b8212 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u030312 1 \u2212 \u03b812 ) , \u03b8\u030312 \u03b812 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u030312 1 \u2212 \u03b812 ) , ( 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u030312 1 \u2212 \u03b812 ) ."}, {"heading": "6. Multi-way sensitivity analysis in multilinear models", "text": "So far we have concentrated on one-way sensitivity analysis only, the most commonly performed in practice. We now consider multi-way sensitivity methods where more than one parameter is varied contemporaneously. We first focus on a specific type of analysis, usually referred to as fully single CPT analysis. In this type of method one parameter from each probability table given a configuration of parents, \u03b8i j\u03c0, is varied in a BN model. So, for instance, if a vertex has n possible configurations of parent variables, then these n parameters are varied.\n6.1. Full single conditional probability table analysis We now generalize the full single CPT methods from BNs to general multilinear models. This type of analysis is simpler than other multi-way methods since the parameters varied/covaried never appear in the same monomial of the BN interpolating polynomial. So we now find an analogous to this CPT analysis in multilinear models which has the same property. Suppose we vary n parameters \u03b81i , . . . , \u03b8ni and denote by \u0398 j = {\u03b8 j1 , . . . , \u03b8 jr j }, j \u2208 [n], the set of parameters including \u03b8 ji and associated to the same (conditional) random variable. Assume these sets are such that \u2229 j\u2208[n]\u0398 j = \u2205. Note that a collection of such sets can not only be associated to CPTs of one vertex given different parent configurations, but also, for instance, to positions along the same cut in a CEG [46].\nRecall that T \u2286 A is the exponent set associated to the event described by YT . Let now T j \u2286 {0, 1}k be the subset of T including the exponents where the entry associated to an indeterminate in \u0398 j is not zero. Let T\u2212 j,k \u2286 {0, 1}k\u22121 be the set including the elements of T j where the entry relative to \u03b8 jk is deleted.

The probability of interest can be written as p\u03b8(yT ) = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T \u03b8\u03b1 = \u2211 j\u2208[n] \u2211 k\u2208[r j] \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\u2212 j,k \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j,k\u03b8 jk + \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\\u222al\u2208[n]Tl \u03b8\u03b1 = \u2211 j\u2208[n] \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\u2212 j,i \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j,i\u03b8 ji + \u2211 j\u2208[n] \u2211 k\u2208[r j]\\{ ji} \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\u2212 j,k \u03b8\u03b1\u2212 j,k\u03b8 jk + \u2211 \u03b1\u2208T\\\u222al\u2208[n]Tl \u03b8\u03b1.\nThe result follows by substituting the varying parameters with their varied version.\nProposition 7 specifies that the sensitivity function in full single CPT analyses is still a linear function, though in this case of n indeterminates. Given this observation, the results of Section 3.2 can be generalized straightforwardly to full single CPT analyses by simply adapting the notation and summing over the index j of the spaces \u0398 j.\nWe next characterize the form of the CD distance for multilinear models in full table CPT analyses, first generalizing its form, again derived in [41] for BN models. Importantly, we then prove that the proportional covariation scheme is optimal for this type of analysis. Several authors have posed this problem without finding a definitive answer [10, 41]. Here, exploiting our polynomial model representation, we can prove the optimality of the proportional scheme not only for BN models, but also for multilinear ones.\nTheorem 3. Consider a multilinear model P\u03a8. Suppose \u03b8 ji is varied to \u03b8\u0303 ji and that \u03b8 jk \u2208 \u0398 j \\ {\u03b8 jk } is covaried to \u03b8\u0303 jk according to a valid covariation scheme, j \u2208 [n], k \u2208 [r j] \\ { ji}. The CD distance between p\u03b8 and p\u03b8\u0303 is then minimized under a proportional variation scheme and can written in closed form as\nCDpro(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln maxj\u2208[n] { \u03b8\u0303 ji \u03b8 ji , 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303 ji 1 \u2212 \u03b8 ji } \u2212 ln min j\u2208[n] { \u03b8\u0303 ji \u03b8 ji , 1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303 ji 1 \u2212 \u03b8 ji } . (16)\nProof. Let now A j be the subset of A including the exponents where the entry associated to an indeterminate in \u0398 j is not zero. As in the proof of Theorem 2, we can deduce that only monomials whose exponent is in A j, j \u2208 [n], have an impact on the distance. Since no two parameters in \u222a j\u2208[n]\u0398 j can have exponent non-zero in the same monomial, we can deduce\nCD(p\u03b8, p\u03b8\u0303) = ln max j\u2208[n],k\u2208[r j] \u03b8\u0303 jk \u03b8 jk \u2212 ln min j\u2208[n],k\u2208[r j] \u03b8\u0303 jk \u03b8 jk\n= ln max {\nmax k\u2208[r1] \u03b8\u03031k \u03b81k , . . . , max k\u2208[rn] \u03b8\u0303nk \u03b8nk\n} \u2212 ln min { min k\u2208[r1] \u03b8\u03031k \u03b81k , . . . , min k\u2208[rn] \u03b8\u0303nk \u03b8nk } .\n(17) Now, as in the proof of Corollary 5, let \u03b8\u0304 ji = \u03b8\u0303 ji and suppose \u03b8\u0304 jk \u2208 \u0398 j \\ {\u03b8 ji } is obtained via a valid covariation scheme, j \u2208 [n], k \u2208 [r j]. Since, by Corollary 5, the proportional scheme is optimal for one-way sensitivity analyses we must have that, for all j \u2208 [n],\nmax k\u2208[r j] \u03b8\u0304 jk \u03b8 jk \u2265 max k\u2208[r j] \u03b8\u0303 jk \u03b8 jk , and min k\u2208[r j] \u03b8\u0304 jk \u03b8 jk \u2264 min k\u2208[r j] \u03b8\u0303 jk \u03b8 jk .\nTherefore,\nmax {\nmax k\u2208[r1] \u03b8\u03041k \u03b81k , . . . , max k\u2208[rn] \u03b8\u0304nk \u03b8nk\n} \u2265 max { max k\u2208[r1] \u03b8\u03031k \u03b81k , . . . , max k\u2208[rn] \u03b8\u0303nk \u03b8nk } ,\nand\nmin {\nmin k\u2208[r1] \u03b8\u03041k \u03b81k , . . . , min k\u2208[rn] \u03b8\u0304nk \u03b8nk\n} \u2264 min { min k\u2208[r1] \u03b8\u03031k \u03b81k , . . . , min k\u2208[rn] \u03b8\u0303nk \u03b8nk } ,\nfrom which the optimality condition follows. The explicit form of the distance under a proportional covariation schemes in equation (16) follows by replacing \u03b8 ji and \u03b8 jk with \u03b8\u0303 ji and \u03b8 jk (1 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303 ji )/(1 \u2212 \u03b8 ji ), respectively, in equation (17), for j \u2208 [n], k \u2208 [r j] \\ { ji} .\n6.2. Multi-way analysis Our polynomial approach, as shown in the previous section, has proven useful in investigating the full single CPT case. We now discuss how more general multi-way sensitivity analysis methods for multilinear methods can be described within our framework.\nExample 17. Consider the vaccination example described by the CEG in Figure 4 and suppose we are now interested in the probability of vaccination as a function of both the probability of an inconclusive test \u03b811 and the probability of the newborn being healthy given an inconclusive test \u03b821. From the interpolating polynomial of this CEG give in equation (3) we can deduce that\nfyT (\u03b8\u030311, \u03b8\u030321) = \u03b1\u03b8\u030311\u03b8\u030321 + \u03b2\u03b8\u030311 + \u03b3\u03c3(\u03b812, \u03b8\u030311) + \u03b4\u03c3(\u03b813, \u03b8\u030311), (18)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus, in this case the sensitivity function is not a simple linear function, but has an interaction term \u03b1\u03b8\u030311\u03b8\u030321. The interpolating polynomial however gives a simple tool to identify the form of the sensitivity function in multilinear models. We plot these functions in Figure 9 under the proportional and the uniform scheme. Both exhibit an almost linear behaviour and are increasing in both indeterminates. These graphs can be used in more refined sensitivity analyses to investigate the effects of contemporaneous parameter changes.\nNote that the indeterminates in equation (18) coincide with those monomials \u03c6 of Proposition 5 that have an impact on the CD distance. Therefore we can interpret the computation of the CD distance for multilinear models, including BNs, for multi-way analyses as the computation of the distance in one-way analyses for non-multilinear models. Example 15 would therefore suggest that the proportional covariation scheme is not optimal in this context. However, we notice that the monomials from multi-way analyses in multilinear models are a subset of those arising from non-multilinear models: although these can be of an arbitrary degree, each indeterminate of the monomial will have exponent one by construction. Therefore, there is no conclusive proof of the non-optimality of the proportional scheme in multi-way analyses for multilinear models and BNs."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "The definition of a parametric model through its interpolating polynomial has proven useful to investigate how changes in the input probabilities affect an output of interest. We have been able to demonstrate that standard results for BN models are valid for a large number of other models, for instance context-specific BNs and square-free CEGs. Then, the flexibility of the interpolating polynomial representation enabled us to investigate an even larger class of models, for instance DBNs and non square-free CEGs, extending sensitivity methods to dynamic settings. In this framework both sensitivity functions and CD distances exhibit different properties than in the simpler multilinear case, with the potential of even more informative sensitivity investigations. We then proved the optimality of the proportional covariation scheme in full conditional CPT analyses not only for BNs but also multilinear models.\nIn this paper we have focused on discrete probabilistic models, but the notion of an interpolating polynomial can be generalized to both continuous and decision-analytic domains. In particular, this could be defined over the polynomial ring whose indeterminates are some of the (conditional) moments of the random variables, the ones that are formally required to compute an expected utility function. Variation of the value of the moments could be implemented to study the robustness of decision making in continuous domains, defining generalizations of the methods in [31].\nLastly, as customary in this type of sensitivity analyses, our approach assumes that the models\u2019 probabilities are known. However, both in machine learned and expert elicited models this will not be the case and uncertainty measures associated to these probabilities are often available. We are starting to investigate methods that take into account the uncertainty about the probability parameters and that explore the effects of treating these numbers as known."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Christiane Go\u0308rgen was supported by the EPSRC grant EP/L505110/1, whilst Jim Q.
