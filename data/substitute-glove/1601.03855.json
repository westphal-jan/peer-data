Introduction", "text": "The K-armed dueling bandit problem is a variation of the classical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem introduced by Yue and Joachims (2009) to formalize the exploration/exploitation dilemma in learning from preference feedback. In its utility-based formulation, at each time period, the environment sets a bounded value for each of K arms. Simultaneously the learner selects two arms and wagers that one of the arms will be better than the other. The learner only sees the outcome of the duel between the selected arms (i.e. the feedback indicates which of the selected arms has better value) and receives the average of the rewards of the selected arms. The goal of the learner is to maximize her cumulative reward. The difficulty of this problem stems from the fact that the learning algorithm has no way of directly observing the reward of its actions. This is a perfect example of partial monitoring problem as defined in Piccolboni and Schindelhauer (2001).\nProceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copyright 2015 by the author(s).\nRelative feedback is naturally suited to many practical applications like user-perceived product preferences, where a relative perception: \u201cA is better than B\u201d is easier to obtain than its absolute counterpart: \u201cA value is 42, B is worth 33\u201d. Another important application of dueling bandits comes from information retrieval systems where users provide implicit feedback about the provided results. This implicit feedback is collected in various ways e.g. a click on a link, a tap, or any monitored action of the user. In all these ways however, this kind of feedback is often strongly biased by the model itself (the user cannot click on a link which was not proposed).\nTo remove this bias in search engines, Radlinski and Joachims (2007) propose to interleave the outputs of different ranking models: the model which scores a click wins the duel. The accuracy of this interleave filtering method was highlighted in several experimental studies (Radlinski and Joachims, 2007; Joachims et al., 2007; Chapelle et al., 2012).\nMain contribution\nThe main contribution of this article is an algorithm designed for the adversarial utility-based dueling bandit problem in contrast to most of the existing algorithms which assume a stochastic environment.\nOur algorithm, called Relative Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (REX3), is a non-trivial extension of the Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3) algorithm (Auer et al., 2002b) to the dueling bandit problem. We prove a finite time expected regret upper bound of order O( \u221a K ln(K)T ) and develop an argument initially proposed by Ailon et al. (2014) to exhibit a general lower bound of order \u2126( \u221a KT ) for this problem.\nThese two bounds correspond to the original bounds of the classical EXP3 algorithm and the upper bound strictly improves from the O\u0303(K \u221a T ) obtained by existing generic\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n03 85\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 Ja\nn 20\npartial monitoring algorithms.1\nOur experiments on information retrieval datasets show that the anytime version of REX3 is a highly competitive algorithm for dueling bandits, especially in the initial phases of the runs where it clearly outperforms the state of the art.\nOutline\nThis article is organized as follows: In section 2, we give a brief survey on dueling bandits with section 2.3 dedicated to the adversarial case. Most notations and formalizations are introduced in this section. Secondly, in section 3, we formally describe REX3 with its pseudo-code. Then, in section 4.1, we provide the upper bound on the expected regret of REX3. Furthermore, in section 4.2, we provide the lower bound on the regret of any algorithm attempting to solve the adversarial utility-based dueling bandit problem. Section 5 begins with an empirical study of the bound given in section 4.1. It then provides comparisons of REX3 with state-of-the art algorithms on information retrieval datasets. The conclusion is provided in section 6."}, {"heading": "2.

Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation", "text": "Of particular interest are the Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3) and its variants presented by Auer et al.

For a fixed horizon T and K arms, the EXP3 algorithm provides an expected cumulative regret bound of order O( \u221a K ln(K)T ) against the best single-arm strategy. This algorithm is indeed adversarial because it does not require a stochastic assumption on the rewards. It is although not anytime because it requires the knowledge of the horizon T to run properly. A \u201cdoubling trick\u201d solution is proposed by Auer et al. (2002b) to preserve the regret bound when T is unknown. It consists of running EXP3 in a carefully designed sequence of increasing epochs. Another elegant solution was later proposed by Seldin et al. (2012) for the same purpose.\n1The notation O\u0303(\u00b7) hides logarithmic factors."}, {"heading": "2.2. Previous work on stochastic dueling bandits", "text": "The dueling bandits problem is recent, although related to previous works on computing with noisy comparison (see for instance Karp and Kleinberg, 2007). This problem also falls under the framework of preference learning (Freund et al., 2003; Liu, 2009; Fu\u0308rnkranz and Hu\u0308llermeier, 2010) which deals with learning of (predictive) preference models from observed (or extracted) preference information i.e. relative feedback which specifies which of the chosen alternatives is preferred. Most of the articles hitherto published on dueling bandits consider the problem under a stochastic assumption.\nYue and Joachims (2009) propose an algorithm called Dueling Bandit Gradient Descent (DBGD) to solve a version of the dueling bandits problem where context information is provided. They approach (contextual) dueling bandits as an on-line convex optimization problem.\nYue et al. (2012) propose an algorithm called Interleaved Flitering (IF). Their formulation is stochastic and matrixbased: for each pair (i, j) of arms, there is an unknown probability Pi,j for i to win against j. This preference matrix P of size K\u00d7K must satisfy the following symetry property:\n\u2200i, j \u2208 {1, . . . ,K}, Pi,j + Pj,i = 1 (1)\nHence on the diagonal: Pi,i = 12 \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . ,K}. Let i\u2217 be the \u201cbest arm\u201d (as we will see later, this best arm coincides with the notion of Condorcet winner). Yue et al. (2012) define the regret incurred at the time instant t when arms a and b are pulled as:\nr\u2032a,b = Pi\u2217,a + Pi\u2217,b \u2212 1 2 \u2208 (0, 1 2 ) (2)\nWe will call this regret a Condorcet regret.\nFor the IF algorithm to work, the P matrix is expected to satisfy several strong assumptions: strict linear ordering, stochastic transitivity, and stochastic triangular inequality. Under these three assumptions IF is guaranteed to suffer an expected cumulative regret of order O(K log T ). Yue and Joachims (2011) introduce Beat The Mean (BTM), an algorithm which proceeds by successive elimination of arms. This algorithm is less constrained than IF as it also applies to a relaxed setting where the preference matrix can slighlty violate the stochastic transitivity assumption. Its cumulative regret bound is of order O(\u03b37K log T ) where \u03b3 is here a known parameter.\nUrvoy et al. (2013) propose a generic algorithm called SAVAGE (for Sensitivity Analysis of VAriables for Generic Exploration) which does away with several assumptions made in the previous algorithms e.g. existence of inherent values of arms, existence of a linear order amongst arms. In\nthis general setting, the SAVAGE algorithm obtains a regret bound of order O(K2 log T ). The key notions they introduce for dueling bandits are the Copeland, Borda and Condorcet scores (Charon and Hudry, 2010). The Borda score of an arm i on a preference matrix P is \u2211K j=1 Pi,j and its Copeland score is \u2211K j=1JPi,j > 12K (We use J . . .K to denote the indicator function). If an arm has a Copeland score of K \u2212 1, which means that it defeats all the other arms in the long run, it is called a Condorcet winner. The existence of a Condorcet winner is the minimum assumption required for the Condorcet regret as defined on equation (2) to be applicable. There exists however some datasets like MSLR30K (2012) where this Condorcet condition is not satisfied.\nZoghi et al. (2014a) extend the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm (Auer et al., 2002a) and propose an algorithm called Relative Upper Confidence Bound (RUCB) provided that the preference matrix admits a Condorcet winner. They retrieve anO(K log T ) bound under this sole assumption. Unlike the previous algorithms, RUCB is an anytime dueling bandits algorithm since it does not require the time horizon T as input.\nAilon et al. (2014) propose three methods (DOUBLER, MULTISMB, and SPARRING) to reduce the stochastic utility-based dueling bandits problem to the conventional MAB problem. A stochastic dueling bandits problem is utility-based if the preference is the result of comparisons of the individual utility/reward of the arms. This is a strong restriction from the general \u2013 matrix-based \u2013 formulation of the problem.\nMore formally, there are K probability distributions v1, . . . , vK over [0, 1] associated respectively with arms 1, . . . ,K. Let \u00b51, . . . , \u00b5K be the respective means of v1, . . . , vK . When an arm a is pulled, its reward/utility xa is drawn from the corresponding distribution va2. Let i\u2217 \u2208 arg max\u00b5i be an optimal arm. The regret incurred at the time instant t when arms a and b are pulled is defined as:\nra,b(t) = 2xi\u2217 \u2212 xa \u2212 xb\n2 (3)\nWe will call this regret a bandit regret. With randomized tie-breaking we can rebuild the preference matrix:\nPi,j = P(xi > xj) + 1\n2 P(xi = xj)\nWhen all vi are Bernoulli laws, this reduces to:\nPi,j = \u00b5i \u2212 \u00b5j + 1\n2 (4)\n2Note that we frequently drop the time index when it is unnecessary or clear from context. For instance we simply write xa(t) or simply xa instead of xat(t).\nNote that if \u00b5i > \u00b5j for some arms i and j, then Pi,j > 12 . The best arm in the usual bandit sense hence coincides with the Condorcet winner (which turns out to be the Borda winner too) on the matrix formulation and the expected bandit regret is twice the Condorcet regret as defined in (2):\nEra,b = 2\u00b5i\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5a \u2212 \u00b5b\n2 = Pi\u2217,a + Pi\u2217,b \u2212 1 = 2r\u2032a,b\nSeveral other models and algorithms have been proposed since to handle stochastic dueling bandits. We can cite (Busa-Fekete et al., 2013; 2014; Zoghi et al., 2014b; 2015). See also (Busa-Fekete and Hu\u0308llermeier, 2014) for an extensive survey of this domain."}, {"heading": "2.3. Adversarial dueling bandits", "text": "The bibliography on stochastic dueling bandits is flourishing, but the results about adversarial dueling bandits remain quite scarce.\nA utility-based formulation of the problem is however proposed in Ailon et al. (2014, section 6). In this setting, as in classical adversarial MAB, the environment chooses beforehand an horizon T and a sequence of utility/reward vectors x(t) = (x1(t), . . . , xK(t)) \u2208 [0, 1]K for t = 1, . . . , T . The learning algorithm aims at controling the bandit regret against the best single-arm strategy, as defined in (3), by choosing properly the pairs of arms (i, j) to be compared.\nTo tackle this problem, Ailon et al. (2014) suggest to apply the SPARRING reduction algorithm, although originally designed for stochastic settings, with an adversarial bandit algorithm like EXP3 as a black-box MAB. According to the authors, the SPARRING reduction preserves the O( \u221a KT lnK) upper bound of EXP3. This algorithm uses two separate MABs (one for each arm). As a consequence, when it gets a relative feedback about a duel (i, j), the left instantiation of EXP3 only updates its weight for arm i while the right instantiation only updates for j. The algorithm we propose improves from this solution by centralizing information for both arms on a single weight vector.\nAs mentionned earlier, the dueling bandits problem is a special instance of a partial monitoring game (Piccolboni and Schindelhauer, 2001; Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2009; Barto\u0301k et al., 2014). A partial monitoring game is defined by two matrices: a loss matrix L and a feedback matrix H. These two matrices are known by the learner. At each round, the learner chooses an action a while the environment simultaneously chooses an outcome (say x). The learner receives a feedback H(a,x) and suffers (in a blind manner) a loss L(a,x). It is straightforward to encode the classical MAB as a finite partial monitoring game: the actions are arms indices a \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} while the environment outcomes\nare reward vectors x(t) = (x1(t), . . . , xK(t)) \u2208 [0, 1]K . The loss and feedback matrices are respectivly defined by L(a,x) = \u2212xa and H(a,x) = xa. For the utility-based dueling bandits problem, the learner\u2019s actions are the duels (a, b) \u2208 {1, . . . ,K}2 and the environment outcomes are reward vectors. If we constrain the rewards to be binary it turns out to be a finite partial monitoring game. The Loss matrix is defined by L ((a, b),x) = \u2212(xa + xb)/2 and the feedback byH ((a, b),x) = \u03c8(xa \u2212 xb) where \u03c8 is a nondecreasing transfer function such that \u03c8(0) = 0 (usually \u03c8(x) = Jx > 0K or \u03c8(x) = x). There are only four classes of finite partial monitoring games in term of time lower bounds, namely: trivial games with no regret at all, \u201ceasy\u201d games with \u0398\u0303 (\u221a T ) minimax regret, \u201chard\u201d games with \u0398\u0303 ( T 2/3 ) , and hopeless\u2019 games with \u2126 (T ) regret.\nSeveral generic partial monitoring algorithms were recently proposed for both stochastic and adversarial settings (see Barto\u0301k et al., 2014, for details). If we except GLOBALEXP3 (Barto\u0301k, 2013) which tries to capture more finely the structure of the games, these algorithms only focus on the time bound and perform inefficiently when the number of actions grows.\nIn a dueling bandit the number of non-duplicate actions is actually K(K + 1)/2 and these algorithms, including GLOBALEXP3, provide at best a O\u0303 ( K \u221a T )\nregret guarantee. The dedicated algorithm that we propose is using the preference feedback more efficiently."}, {"heading": "3. Relative Exponential-weight Algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation", "text": "The pseudo-code for the algorithm we propose is given in Algorithm 1. As previously stated on Section 2.3, this algorithm is designed to apply for the adversarial utility-based dueling bandits problem.\nIt is similar to the original EXP3 from step 1 to step 6 where it computes a distribution p(t) = (p1(t), . . . , pK(t)) which is a mixture of a normalized weighing of the arms wi/ \u2211 i wi and a uniform distribution 1/K. As in EXP3, this uniform probability is introduced to ensure a minimum exploration of all arms.\nAt step 7, the algorithm draws two arms a and b independently according to p(t). At step 8, the algorithm gets \u03c8(xa \u2212 xb) as relative feedback . Note that, since arms are drawn with replacement, we may have a = b, in which case the algorithm will get no information. This event is indeed expected to become frequent when the p(t) distribution becomes peaked around the best arms. This necessity for a regret-minimizing dueling bandits algorithm to\nrenounce getting information when confident about its decision is a structural bias toward exploitation that is not encountered in classical bandits.\nStep 8 is the big difference from EXP3; because we only have access to the relative \u03c8(xa \u2212 xb) value, we have no mean to estimate the individual rewards xa or xb. There is however a solution to circumvent this problem: the best arm in expectation at time t is not only the one which maximizes the absolute reward. It is indeed the one which maximizes the regret of any fixed strategy \u03c0(t) against it:\narg max i xi(t) = arg max i\n( xi(t)\u2212 Ea\u223c\u03c0(t)xa ) .\nThis reference strategy could be a single-arm or uniform strategy but playing a suboptimal strategy to get a reference has a cost in terms of regret. One of our contributions is to show that the algorithm may use its own strategy as a reference.\nAt step 9, the condition a 6= b is only a slight improvement for matrix-based dueling bandits where the outcome of a duel of an arm against itself is randomized as in (4).\nAt steps 10 and 11, the weights of the played arms are updated. This update process is the core of our algorithm, it will be detailed in Section 4.\nStep 13 is only required for the anytime version of the algorithm. It will be explained in section 5.2.\nAlgorithm 1 REX3: Exp3 with relative feedback 1: Parameters: \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1] 2: Initialization: wi(1) = 1 for i = 1, . . . ,K. 3: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 4: for i = 1, . . . ,K do 5: Set pi(t)\u2190 (1\u2212 \u03b3) wi(t)\u2211K\nj=1 wj(t) + \u03b3K\n6: end for 7: Pull two arms a and b chosen independently according to the distribution (p1(t), . . . , pK(t)). 8: Receive relative feedback \u03c8(xa \u2212 xb) \u2208 [\u22121,+1] 9: if a 6= b then\n10: Set wa(t+ 1)\u2190 wa(t) \u00b7 e \u03b3 K \u03c8(xa\u2212xb) 2pa 11: Set wb(t+ 1)\u2190 wb(t) \u00b7 e\u2212 \u03b3 K \u03c8(xa\u2212xb) 2pb 12: end if 13: Update \u03b3 (for anytime version) 14: end for"}, {"heading": "4. Analysis", "text": "For the analysis, we focus on the simple case where \u03c8 is the identity. It provides a ternary win/tie/loss feedback if we assume binary rewards. The main difference between EXP3 and our algorithm is at steps 10 and 11 of Algorithm 1,\nwhere we update the weights according to the duel outcome: the winning arm is gratified while the loser is penalized. This \u2018punitive\u2019 approach of exponential weighing departs from EXP3 and other weighing algorithms which gratify the most rewarding arms while kindly ignoring the nonrewarding ones (Freund and Schapire, 1999; Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006).\n4.1. Upper bound for REX3\nIn this section, we provide a finite-horizon non-stochastic upper bound on the expected regret against the best single action policy.\nThe steps 10-11 on Algorithm 1 are equivalent to operating for each arm i an update of the form:\nwi(t+ 1) = wi(t) \u00b7 e \u03b3 K c\u0302i(t)\nwhere\nc\u0302i(t) = Ji = aK \u03c8(xa \u2212 xb) 2pa + Ji = bK\u03c8(xb \u2212 xa) 2pb (5)\nOne big difference with EXP3 is that c\u0302i(t) not an estimator of the reward xi(t).

If we rather take \u03c8(x) = Jx > 0K, then Ec\u0302i(t) = Pa\u223cp(t) (xi(t) > xa(t)), i.e. the probability for the algorithm to select an arm defeated by i.

When \u03b3 = min { 1 2 , \u221a K ln(K) \u03c4 } , the expected regret of REX3 (Algorithm 1) is O (\u221a K ln(K)T ) .\nThe upper bound of REX3 for adversarial utility-based dueling bandits is hence the same as the one of EXP3 for aversarial MABs. For a high-number of arms or a short term horizon, this bound is competitive against theO (K ln(T )) or O ( K2 ln(T ) ) existing bounds for stochastic dueling bandits."}, {"heading": "4.2.

The expected classicalbandit gain of Algorithm 2 will be twice the expected gain of the black-box dueling bandits it uses.\nIt is important to note that this reduction only works for stochastic settings where the expected reward of each arm remains the same across time instants.

We plotted two theoretical curves: one with a conservative Gmax = T/2, and a riskier one with Gmax = T/4.

It also shows that the theoretical optimal \u03b3\u2217 we obtain with Equation (6) is a good guess even with a conservative upper-bound for Gmax."}, {"heading": "5.2. Interleave filtering simulations", "text": "For our experiments we have considered the following state of the art algorithms: BTM (Yue and Joachims, 2011) with \u03b3 = 1.1 and \u03b4 = 1/T (explore-then-exploit setting), Condorcet-SAVAGE (Urvoy et al., 2013) with \u03b4 = 1/T , RUCB (Zoghi et al., 2014a) with \u03b1 = 0.51, and SPARRING coupled with EXP3 (Ailon et al., 2014). We also took the uniform sampling strategy RANDOM as a baseline. We considered three versions of REX3: two non-anytime versions where the optimal \u03b3\u2217 is computed beforehand according to (6) with Gmax set respectively to T/2 and T/10 and one anytime version where \u03b3\u2217 is recomputed at each time step according to (6) (see Seldin et al., 2012, for details about this form of \u201cdoubling trick\u201d).\nA point which makes the comparison difficult is that some algorithms are anytime while others require the horizon as input. For anytime algorithms, namely RANDOM, RUCB and REX3 with adaptive \u03b3, we displayed the average over 100 runs of the progressive accumulation of regret while for\nnon-anytime algorithms, namely BTM, CSAVAGE, SPARRING and other versions of REX3, we displayed the average over 50 runs of the final cumulative regret for several fixed and known horizons. This protocol is slightly favorable to non-anytime algorithms which benefit from more information. However, for elimination algorithms like BTM and CSAVAGE the difference between the anytime regret and the non-anytime regret is small. For adversarial algorithms like SPARRING and REX3 the \u201cdoubling trick\u201d can be applied to make them anytime: the adaptive \u03b3 version of REX3 is an example of such a fixed-to-anytime transformation.\nThe results of these experiments are summarized in Figure 2, and 3. Furthermore, similar experiments are given as extended material.\nAs expected, the adversarial-setting algorithms SPARRING and REX3 follow an O( \u221a T ) regret curve while the stochastic-setting algorithms follow an O(lnT ) curve. Among the adversarial-setting algorithms, REX3 is shown to outperform SPARRING on all datasets. In the long run, adversarial-setting algorithms continue exploring and cannot compete in terms of regret against stochastic-setting algorithms, but the accuracy curves show that the cost of this exploration is very small. Moreover, for small horizons or high number of rankers, REX3 is extremely competitive against other algorithms.\nThis difference is clearly illustrated on the left-hand side of Figure 3 where we show the evolution of the expected cumulative regret at a fixed time horizon (T = 105) according to the number of arms. To obtain this plot we averaged the regret over 50 runs. For each K and each run we sampled uniformly K dimensions of the original 136\u00d7136 MSLR30K navigational preference matrix."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "We proposed REX3, an exponential weighing algorithm for adversarial utility-based dueling bandits. We provided both an upper and a lower bound for its expected cumulative regret. These two bounds match the original bounds of the classical EXP3 algorithm.

It also showed that REX3 and especially its anytime version with adaptive \u03b3 are competitive solutions for dueling bandits, even when compared to stochastic-setting algorithms in a stochastic environment."}, {"heading": "A.

Relative feedback is naturally suited to many practical applications like user-perceived product preferences, where a relative perception: \u201cA is better than B\u201d is easier to obtain than its absolute counterpart: \u201cA value is 42, B is worth 33\u201d. Another important application of dueling bandits comes from information retrieval systems where users provide implicit feedback about the provided results. This implicit feedback is collected in various ways e.g. a click on a link, a tap, or any monitored action of the user. In all these ways however, this kind of feedback is often strongly biased by the model itself (the user cannot click on a link which was not proposed).
