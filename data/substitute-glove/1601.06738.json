Whether or not this principle tells the whole story, it is certainly important as we undoubtedly manage to create and understand novel combinations of words. Fuzzy set theory has long been considered a useful framework for the modelling of natural language expressions, as it provides a functional calculus for concept combination [30, 32].\nA simple example of compositionality is hedged concepts. Hedges are words such as \u2018very\u2019, \u2018quite\u2019, \u2018more or less\u2019, \u2018extremely\u2019. They are usually modelled as transforming the membership function of a base concept to either narrow or broaden the extent of application of that concept. So, given a concept \u2018short\u2019, the term \u2018very short\u2019 applies to fewer objects than \u2018short\u2019, and \u2018quite short\u2019 to more. Modelling a hedge as a transformation of a concept allows us to determine membership of an object in the hedged concept as a function of its membership in the base concept, rather than building the hedged concept from scratch [31].\nLinguistic hedges have been widely applied, including in fuzzy classifiers [6, 7, 20, 22] and database queries [1, 3]. Using linguistic hedges in these applications allows increased accuracy in rules or queries whilst maintaining human interpretability of results [4, 23]. This motivates the need for a semantically grounded account of linguistic hedges: if hedged results are more interpretable then the hedges used must themselves be meaningful.\nIn the following we provide an account of linguistic hedges that is both functional, and semantically grounded. In its most basic formulation, the operation requires no additional parameters, although we also show that the formulae can be generalised if necessary. Our account of linguistic hedges uses the label semantics framework to model concepts [17]. This is a random set approach which quantifies an agent\u2019s subjective uncertainty about the extent of application of a concept. We refer to this uncertainty as semantic uncertainty [19] to emphasise that it concerns the definition of concepts and categories, in contrast to stochastic uncertainty which concerns the state of the world. In [19] the label semantics approach is combined with conceptual spaces [14] and prototype theory [25], to give a formalisation of concepts as based on a prototype and a threshold, located in a conceptual space. This approach is discussed in detail in section 2. An outline of the paper is then as follows: section 3 discusses different approaches to linguistic hedges\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n06 73\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 5\nJa n\nfrom the literature, and compares these with our model. Subsequently, in section 4, we give formulations of the hedges \u2018very\u2019 and \u2018quite\u2019. These are formed by considering the dependence of the threshold of a hedged concept on the threshold of the original concept. We give a basic model and two generalisations, show that the models can be composed and investigate the behaviour in the limit of composition. Section 5 compares our results to those in the literature and proposes further lines of research."}, {"heading": "2 Theoretical approach to concepts", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Prototype theory and fuzzy set theory", "text": "Prototype theory views concepts as being defined in terms of prototypes, rather than by a set of necessary and sufficient conditions. Elements from an underlying metric space then have graded membership in a concept depending on their similarity to a prototype for the concept. There is some evidence that humans use natural categories in this way, as shown in experiments reported in [25]. Fuzzy set theory [30] was proposed as a calculus for combining and modifying concepts with graded membership, and extended these ideas in [32] to linguistic variables as variables taking words as values, rather than numbers. For example, \u2018height\u2019 can be viewed as a linguistic variable taking values \u2018short,\u2019 \u2018tall\u2019, \u2018very tall\u2019, etc. The variable relates to an underlying universe of discourse \u2126, which for the concept \u2018tall\u2019 could be R+. Then each value L of the variable is associated with a fuzzy subset of \u2126, and a function \u00b5L : \u2126 \u2192 [0, 1] associates with each x \u2208 \u2126 the value of its membership in L. Prototype theory gives a semantic basis to fuzzy sets through the notion of similarity to a prototype, as described in [10]. In this context, concepts are represented by fuzzy sets and membership of an element in a concept is quantified by its similarity to the prototype. In this situation the fuzziness of the concept is seen as inherent to the concept. An alternative interpretation for fuzzy sets is random set theory, see [10] for an exposition. Here, the fuzziness of a set comes from uncertainty about a crisp set, i.e. semantic uncertainty, rather than fuzziness inherent in the world. This second approach is the stance taken by [19], and which we now adopt in this paper."}, {"heading": "2.2 Conceptual Spaces", "text": "Conceptual spaces are proposed by Ga\u0308rdenfors in [14] as a framework for representing information at the conceptual level. Ga\u0308rdenfors contrasts his theory with both a symbolic, logical approach to concepts, and an associationist approach where concepts are represented as associations between different kinds of basic information elements. Rather, conceptual spaces are geometrical structures based on quality dimensions such as weight, height, hue, brightness, etc. It is assumed that conceptual spaces are metric spaces, with an associated distance measure. This might be Euclidean distance, or any other appropriate metric. The distance measure can be used to formulate a measure of similarity, as needed for prototype theory - similar objects are close together in the conceptual space, very different objects are far apart.\nTo develop the conceptual space framework, Ga\u0308rdenfors also introduces the notion of integral and separable dimensions. Dimensions are integral if assignment of a value in one dimension implies assignment of a value in another, such as depth and breadth. Conversely, separable dimensions are those where there is no such implication, such as height and sweetness. A domain is then defined as a set of quality dimensions that are separable from all other dimensions, and a conceptual space is defined as a collection of one or more domains.\nGa\u0308rdenfors goes on to define a property as a convex region of a domain in a conceptual space. A concept is defined as a set of such regions that are related via a set of salience weights. This casting of (at least) properties as convex regions of a domain sits very well with prototype theory, as Ga\u0308rdenfors points out. If properties are convex regions of a space, then it is possible to say that an object is more or less central to that region. Because the region is convex, its centroid will lie within the region, and this centroid can be seen as the prototype of the property."}, {"heading": "2.3 Label Semantics", "text": "The label semantics framework was proposed by [17] and related to prototype theory and conceptual spaces in [19]. In this framework, agents use a set of labels LA = {L1, L2, ..., Ln} to describe an underlying conceptual space \u2126 which has a distance metric d(x, y) between points. In fact, it is sufficient that d(x, y) be a pseudo-distance. When x or y is a set, say Y , we take d(x, Y ) = min{d(x, y) : y \u2208 Y }. In this case, the set Y is seen as an ontic set, i.e., a set where all elements are jointly prototypes, as opposed to an epistemic set describing a precise but unknown prototype, as described in [11]. Each label Li is associated with firstly a set of prototype values Pi \u2286 \u2126, and secondly a threshold \u03b5i, about which the agents are uncertain. The thresholds \u03b5i are drawn from probability distributions \u03b4\u03b5i . Labels Li are associated with neighbourhoods N \u03b5iLi = {x \u2208 \u2126 : d(x, Pi) \u2264 \u03b5i}. The neighbourhood can be seen as the extension of the concept Li. The intuition here is that \u03b5i captures the idea of being sufficiently close to prototypes Pi. In other words, x \u2208 \u2126 is sufficiently close to Pi to be appropriately labelled as Li providing that d(x, Pi) \u2264 \u03b5i.\nGiven an element x \u2208 \u2126, we can ask how appropriate a given label is to describe it. This is quantified by an appropriateness measure, denoted \u00b5Li(x). We are intentionally using the same notation as for the membership function of a fuzzy set. This quantity is the probability that the distance from x to Pi, the prototype of Li, is less than the threshold \u03b5i, as given by:\n\u00b5Li(x) = P (\u03b5i : x \u2208 N \u03b5iLi) = P (\u03b5i : d(x, Pi) \u2264 \u03b5i) = \u222b \u221e d(x,Pi) \u03b4\u03b5i(\u03b5i)d\u03b5i\nWe also use the notation \u222b\u221e d \u03b4\u03b5i(\u03b5i)d\u03b5i = \u2206i(d), according to which \u00b5Li(x) = \u2206i(d(x, Pi)). The above formulation provides a link to the random set interpretation of fuzzy sets. Random sets are random variables taking sets as values. If we viewN \u03b5iLi as a random set from R+ into 2\u2126, then \u00b5Li(x) is the single point coverage function of N \u03b5iLi , as defined in [18], and also commonly called a contour function [26].\nLabels can often be semantically related to each other. For example, the label \u2018pet fish\u2019 is semantically related to the labels \u2018pet\u2019 and \u2018fish\u2019, and the label \u2018very tall\u2019 related to the label \u2018tall\u2019. This prompts two questions: firstly, how the prototypes of each concept are related to each other, and secondly, how the thresholds of each concept are related. Two simple models for the relationships between the thresholds are given in [19]. The consonant model takes all thresholds as being dependent on one common underlying threshold. So, all thresholds have the same distance metric d and are related to a base threshold \u03b5 by the dependency that \u03b5i = fi(\u03b5) for increasing functions fi. In contrast, the independence model takes all thresholds as being independent of each other. This might hold when labels are taken from different conceptual spaces.\nBetween these two extremes, we model dependencies between thresholds as a Bayesian network - i.e., a directed acyclic graph whose edges encode conditional dependence between variables. The key property of this type of network is that the joint distribution of all variables can be broken into factors that depend only on each individual variable and its parents. So, for example, the network in figure 1 can be factorised as \u03b4(\u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53, \u03b54, \u03b55) = \u03b4\u03b51(\u03b51)\u03b4\u03b52(\u03b52)\u03b4\u03b53|\u03b51,\u03b52(\u03b53|\u03b51, \u03b52)\u03b4\u03b54|\u03b52(\u03b54|\u03b52)\u03b4\u03b55|\u03b53(\u03b55|\u03b53).\nThis enables calculation of the joint distribution and therefore marginal distributions in an efficient manner.\nOne intuitively easy example is where the dependency of one threshold \u03b52 on another \u03b51 is that \u03b52 \u2264 \u03b51. This could be taken to model the dependency of the threshold of the concept \u2018very tall\u2019 on the threshold of \u2018tall\u2019. The label \u2018very tall\u2019 should be appropriate to describe fewer people than the label \u2018tall\u2019. Therefore, the threshold for describing someone as \u2018very tall\u2019 will be narrower than the threshold for describing someone as \u2018tall\u2019, i.e. \u03b5very tall \u2264 \u03b5tall. This simple model will form part of the approach to modelling linguistic hedges, as outlined in the sequel."}, {"heading": "3 Approaches to linguistic hedges", "text": "Linguistic hedges have been given varying treatments in the literature. In this section we summarise these different approaches and state the approach that we wish to take, discussing properties that hedge modifiers\nmay need. We give two specific approaches from the literature with which we will compare our results. In [31] the idea of linguistic hedges as operators modifying fuzzy sets was introduced, so that the membership function \u00b5hL(x) of a hedged concept, hL, is a function of the membership of the base concept L, i.e. \u00b5hL(x) = f(\u00b5L(x)). Furthermore, truth can be considered as a linguistic variable and hence a fuzzy set [32], so that the application of a hedge can be seen as modifying the truth value of a sentence using that concept [12, 15, 32]. This second view is useful in approximate reasoning, and allows for an algebraic approach to investigating the properties of linguistic hedges, as introduced in [32], and expanded upon in [5, 12, 15]. The approach we take, however, is to view a hedge as modifying the fuzzy set associated with a concept directly, as taken by [2, 4, 9, 24]. Rather than examining the algebraic properties of hedges or their role in reasoning, we look at how hedges are semantically grounded and argue that our approach provides a particularly clear semantics.\nWe will propose a set of operations that may be used for both expansion and refinement of single concepts. This is in contrast to the work presented in [27] in which information coarsening is effected by taking disjunctions of labels. The idea of a hedged concept has some similarities to that of the bipolar model of concepts described in [28], since if it is appropriate to describe someone as \u2018very tall\u2019, it must be appropriate to describe them as \u2018tall\u2019, and similarly describing someone as \u2018quite tall\u2019 implies that it is not entirely inappropriate to describe them as \u2018tall\u2019. However, we see the concepts derived by application of hedges as labels in their own right which can be used to describe data or objects.\nZadeh divides hedges into two types. A type 1 hedge can be seen as an operator acting on a single fuzzy set. Examples are \u2018very\u2019, \u2018more or less\u2019, \u2018quite\u2019, or \u2018extremely\u2019 [31]. Type 2 hedges are more complicated and include modifiers such as \u2018technically\u2019 or \u2018practically\u2019. In [31] concepts are considered as made up of various different components, with the membership function a weighted sum of the memberships of the individual components. Type 1 hedges operate on all components equally, whereas type 2 hedges differentiate between components. For example, the hedge \u2018essentially\u2019 might give more weight to the most important components in a concept. Type 2 hedges are further explored in [16, 29], where components of a concept are categorised as definitional, primary or secondary, and the hedges \u2018technically\u2019, \u2018strictly speaking\u2019 and \u2018loosely speaking\u2019 are analysed in terms of these categories. Although in the following we restrict ourselves to consideration of type 1 hedges only, the treatment of concepts as having different components is mirrored by the conceptual spaces view, where each component might be seen as a dimension in the conceptual space. Further development of the framework may therefore allow a treatment of type 2 hedges.\nA further distinction between types of hedge lies in the difference between powering or shifting modifiers. Powering modifiers are of the form \u00b5hL(x) = (\u00b5L(x))\nk, where hL refers to the hedged concept and k is some real value, and shifting modifiers are of the form \u00b5hL(x) = (\u00b5L(x \u2212 a)). Zadeh introduces both types of modifier in his discussion of type 1 hedges [31], however his powering modifiers are most frequently cited. These are the concentration operator CON(\u00b5tall(x)) = (\u00b5tall(x)) 2, and the dilation operator DIL(\u00b5tall(x)) =\n(\u00b5tall(x)) 1 2 , which are often taken to implement the hedges \u2018very\u2019 and \u2018quite\u2019, (alternatively \u2018more or less\u2019), respectively. 1\nThe operators CON and DIL leave the core, {x \u2208 \u2126 : \u00b5L(x) = 1}, and support {x \u2208 \u2126 : \u00b5L(x) 6= 0}, of the fuzzy sets unchanged, which is often argued to be undesirable [3, 2, 24, 21]. In particular, [3] argue that in a fuzzy database, if a concentrating hedge is being used to refine a query that is returning too many objects, the hedge needs to reduce the number of objects returned, and hence narrow down the core. Furthermore, [22] find that classifiers using the CON and DIL operators (classical hedges) do not perform as well as those with hedges that modify the core and support of the fuzzy sets. In contrast, Zadeh himself argues that the core should not be altered. The application of a modifier \u2018very\u2019 to a property given by a crisp set should leave that property unchanged: \u2018very square\u2019 is the same as \u2018square\u2019. A fuzzy set is made up of a non-fuzzy part, the core, and a fuzzy part, {x \u2208 \u2126 : 0 < \u00b5L(x) < 1}. Since the core of a fuzzy set is a crisp set, it should be left unchanged. The use of classical hedges does improve performance over non-hedged fuzzy rules in expert systems [6, 7, 20], so the argument against classical hedges is a matter of degree.\nThe use of the CON and DIL operators to model the hedges \u2018very\u2019 and \u2018quite\u2019 is further criticised on the basis that the modifiers are arbitrary and semantically ungrounded. No justification is given for these modifiers other than that they have what seem to be intuitively the right properties [2, 8, 24]. Grounding hedges semantically is important for a theoretical account of what happens when we use terms like \u2018very\u2019 and also for retaining interpretability in fuzzy systems. [2, 8] both ground modifiers using a resemblance relation which takes into account how objects in the universe are similar to each other. [24] takes a horizon shifting approach.\nIn [24] the class of finite numbers is used as an example of the horizon shifting approach. Some numbers are certainly finite, however as numbers get larger, finiteness becomes impossible to verify. Mapping this idea onto the concept \u2018small\u2019, we can say that there is a class of numbers that are definitely small, say [0, c]. As numbers get larger than c we approach the horizon past which the concept \u2018small\u2019 no longer applies, expressed as 1\u2212 (x)(x\u2212 c). So:\n\u00b5small(x) = { 1 if x \u2208 [0, c] 1\u2212 (x)(x\u2212 c) if x \u2265 c\nNow, to implement the hedge \u2018very\u2019, the horizon c is shifted by a factor \u03c3 and the membership function altered thus:\n\u00b5very small(x) = { 1 if x \u2208 [0, \u03c3c] 1\u2212 (x, \u03c3)(x\u2212 \u03c3c) if x \u2265 \u03c3c\nIn [24], examples of different kinds of membership functions that might be used to implement this idea are given. A linear membership function gives (x) = 1a\u2212c where a is the upper limit of the membership function. To implement the hedge, the function (x, \u03c3) = 1\u03c3(a\u2212c) is introduced, giving\n\u00b5small(x) =  1 if x \u2208 [0, c] 1\u2212 x\u2212ca\u2212c if x \u2208 [c, a] 0 otherwise\nand\n\u00b5very small(x) =  1 if x \u2208 [0, \u03c3c] 1\u2212 x\u2212\u03c3c\u03c3(a\u2212c) if x \u2208 [\u03c3c, \u03c3a] 0 otherwise\n[2, 8] both ground their approaches in the idea of looking at the elements near a fuzzy set in order to contract or dilate the set. The two approaches are similar, so we restrict ourselves to that of [2]. This\n1Zadeh in fact proposes a rather more complicated hedge for \u2018more or less\u2019, which involves a combination of powering and shifting, however, the dilation operator is more frequently quoted in the literature.\napproach introduces a fuzzy resemblance relation on the universe of discourse, and either a T -norm in the case of dilation, or a fuzzy implicator for concentration. The modifier is then implemented as follows. Consider a fuzzy set F and a proximity relation EZ which is approximate equality, parametrised by a fuzzy set Z. As described in [2], E is modelled by (u, v)\u2192 E(u, v) = Z(u\u2212 v), where Z is a fuzzy interval centred on 0 with finite support. In terms of a trapezoidal membership function, Z can be expressed as (\u2212z \u2212 a,\u2212z, z, z + a). Therefore, if |u \u2212 v| \u2264 z, u and v are judged to be approximately equal, i.e. EZ(u, v) = 1. The set F is dilated by EZ(F )(s) = supr\u2208\u2126T (F (r), E\nZ(s, r)), where T is any T -norm, min being the standard. To understand the effect that this has on a fuzzy set F , suppose that F has a trapezoidal membership function (A,B,C,D) where [B,C] is the core of F and [A,B], [C,D] the support, and that Z similarly is (\u2212z \u2212 a,\u2212z, z, z + a), with the T-norm min used. Then EZ(F ) = (A\u2212 z \u2212 a,B \u2212 z, C + z,D + z + a).\nConcentration is effected in a similar way: EZ(F )(s) = infr\u2208\u2126I(F (r), EZ(s, r)), where I is a fuzzy implication. If F and Z are as above with the condition that C \u2212 B \u2265 2z, and I is the Go\u0308del implication, then EZ(F ) = (A+ z + a,B + z, C \u2212 z,D \u2212 z \u2212 a).\nFor example, suppose we start with a set F described in trapezoidal notation as F = (A,B,C,D) = (2, 4, 6, 8), and an approximate equality function parametrised by Z = (\u2212z\u2212a,\u2212z, z, z+a) = (\u22121,\u22120.5, 0.5, 1). The dilation of the set F using T-norm min is then:\nEZ(F ) = (A\u2212 z \u2212 a,B \u2212 z, C + z,D + z + a) = (1, 3.5, 6.5, 9) The concentration of the set F using the Go\u0308del implication is:\nEZ(F ) = (A+ z + a,B + z, C \u2212 z,D \u2212 z \u2212 a) = (3, 4.5, 5.5, 7) These effects are illustrated in figure 2.\nThe intuitive idea behind this approach is that if an object x1 resembles another object x2 that is L, then x1 can be said to be \u2018quite L\u2019. Conversely, object x2 that is L can be said to be \u2018very L\u2019 only if all the objects x that resemble it can be said to be L. This formulation alters both the core and support of the fuzzy set L, which has been argued to be a desirable effect.\nFollowing [2, 8, 24], we will propose linguistic modifiers that are semantically grounded rather than attempting to show their utility in classifiers, reasoning or to examine the algebra of modifiers. Our approach to linguistic modifiers arises very naturally from the label semantics framework, and the primary result does not require any parameters additional to the original membership function of the concept. We also show similarities between our model and the two detailed above."}, {"heading": "4 Label semantics approach to linguistic hedges", "text": "We present three formulations of linguistic hedges with increasing levels of generality. The first assumes that prototypes are equal. Secondly, we show that an analogue holds where prototypes are not equal, and thirdly that these hold in the case where the second threshold is a function of the first. We go on to show similarities between our model and those of [2, 8, 24]. Furthermore, we show that hedges are compositional, and look at their behaviour in the limit of composition.\nAs described in section 2.3, LA denotes a finite set of labels {Li} that agents use to describe basic categories. \u2126 is the underlying domain of discourse, with prototypes Pi \u2208 \u2126 and thresholds \u03b5i, drawn from a distribution \u03b4\u03b5i . As before, the appropriateness \u00b5Li(x) = \u2206i(d(x, Pi)) = \u222b\u221e d(x,Pi) \u03b4\u03b5i(\u03b5i)d\u03b5i. We use the notation Li =< Pi, d, \u03b4\u03b5i >. A concept L1 can be narrowed or broadened to a second concept L2 using the linguistic hedges \u2018very\u2019 and \u2018quite\u2019 respectively, i.e. L2 is defined as \u2018quite L1\u2019. The directed acyclic graph illustrating this dependency is given in figure 3. In this case, the threshold \u03b52 associated with L2 is dependent on \u03b51 in that \u03b52 \u2265 \u03b51. In the case of \u2018very\u2019, we have that \u03b52 \u2264 \u03b51. Essentially, for \u2018quite\u2019, we are saying that however wide a margin of certainty we apply the label \u2018tall\u2019 with, the margin for \u2018quite tall\u2019 will be wider, and conversely for \u2018very\u2019."}, {"heading": "4.1 Hedges with unmodified prototypes", "text": "Definition 1 (Dilation and Concentration). A label L2 =< P2, d, \u03b4\u03b52 > is a dilation of a label L1 =< P1, d, \u03b4\u03b51 > when \u03b52 is dependent on \u03b51 such that \u03b52 \u2265 \u03b51. L2 is a concentration of L1 when \u03b52 is dependent on \u03b51 such that \u03b52 \u2264 \u03b51.\nTheorem 2 (L2 = quite L1).

In this case, we can show links to other models of hedges from the literature.\nA simple example of a deterministic dependency is given below.\nExample 13. Suppose \u2126 = R, d is Euclidean distance and that L1 has prototype P = 5 and \u03b5 \u223c Uniform[0, 3]. Then as before,\n\u00b5L(x) = { 1\u2212 |x\u22125|3 if x \u2208 [2, 8] 0 otherwise\nTo implement a dilation hedge, we would form a new label qL with Pq = P = 5 and \u03b5q = kq\u03b5 with kq > 1. For a contraction hedge, we would form the label vL by setting Pv = P = 5 and \u03b5v = kv\u03b5 with kv < 1.

The effect of implementing these hedges is illustrated in figure 9.\nUsing this approach, we can also create an effect similar to that of changing the prototype. Suppose that a label L in a conceptual space \u2126 has a single point P as a prototype, but that the minimum value of the threshold \u03b5 is greater than 0, for example, \u03b5 \u223c Uniform[c, a].

Specifically, we have\n\u00b5L(x) =  1 if x < c a\u2212x a\u2212c if x \u2208 [c, a] 0 otherwise\nForming a hedged concept hL by setting PhL = P = 0 and \u03b5hL = k\u03b5 gives\n\u00b5hL(x) =  1 if x < kc ka\u2212x ka\u2212kc if x \u2208 [kc, ka] 0 otherwise\nComparing this with the model given in section 3, we see that this is precisely the model proposed by [24] in the linear case.\nSimilarity between the hedging effects illustrated in figure 9 and the effects implemented in the model proposed in [2], illustrated in figure 2, can clearly be seen. To derive the model given in [2], we describe the fuzzy sets associated with labels L and hL in trapezoidal notation. Notice that L = (P\u2212a, P\u2212c, P+c, P+a) and hL = (P \u2212 ka, P \u2212 kc, P + kc, P + ka). We can render this transformation in the terms employed by [2]. Consider labels L and hL as fuzzy sets characterised by the appropriateness measure \u00b5L(x) and \u00b5hL(x). Then, in the case of dilation, we have:\nqL = EZ(L)(s) = supr\u2208\u2126T (\u00b5L(s), E Z(s, r))\nand for contraction,\nvL = EZ(L)(s) = infr\u2208\u2126I(\u00b5L(s), E Z(s, r))\nWhen T is the T -norm min, I is the Go\u0308del implication and Z = (\u2212z\u2212\u03b1,\u2212z, z, z+\u03b1) (with the restriction that c < z to ensure a well-defined set), the approach in [2] gives qL = (P \u2212a\u2212z\u2212\u03b1, P \u2212c\u2212z, P +c+z, P + a+z+\u03b1). If we set z = (k\u22121)c and \u03b1 = (k\u22121)(a\u2212c), this is equal to qL = (P \u2212ka, P \u2212kc, P +kc, P +ka).\nHowever, we also require that vL = (P \u2212 ka, P \u2212 kc, P + kc, P + ka). The approach in [2] gives vL = (P\u2212a+z+\u03b1, P\u2212c+z, P+c\u2212z, P+a\u2212z\u2212\u03b1), and we therefore need to set z = (1\u2212k)c and \u03b1 = (1\u2212k)(a\u2212c)\nThis formulation is not as general as given in [2], however, note that it only uses one additional parameter and no additional operators, rather than the two parameters and either a T -norm or implication used by [2].\nTwo more key models from the literature are the powering and shifting modifiers proposed in [31]. Recall that powering modifiers are of the form \u00b5hL(x) = (\u00b5L(x))\nk and shifting modifiers are of the form \u00b5hL(x) = (\u00b5L(x \u2212 a)). Shifting modifiers are easy to implement within our model, simply by shifting the prototype by the quantity a.\nPowering modifiers can be expressed as a function of the threshold \u03b5 given a particular distribution of the threshold \u03b4. Suppose \u2126 = R, \u03b5 \u223c U [0, c], giving\n\u00b5L(x) = { 1\u2212 d(x,P )b if x \u2208 [P \u2212 b, P + b] 0 otherwise\nand suppose a new label hL is formed with prototype P and threshold \u03b5h = f(\u03b5) such that \u00b5hL(x) = \u00b5L(x) k. Then \u00b5hL(x) = \u2206(f \u22121(d(x, P ))) = (\u2206(d(x, P )))k, so\nf\u22121(d(x, P )) = \u2206\u22121((\u2206(d(x, P )))k) = b\u2212 b( (b\u2212 d(x, P )) k bk ) = b\u2212 (b\u2212 d(x, P )) k bk\u22121\nand hence \u03b5hL = f(\u03b5) = b\u2212 (bk\u22121(b\u2212 \u03b5))1/k\nThis expression seems surprisingly complicated, and there may be better ways of deriving the powering hedges that are not as a function of the threshold \u03b5.\nIn this section we have shown that our general model can capture some of the many approaches found in the literature as special cases. We now go on to look at the property of compositionality that is exhibited by a number of models."}, {"heading": "4.5 Compositionality", "text": "One of the features of hedges seen in [2, 8, 24, 31] is that they can be applied multiple times.

Similar to proof of theorem 15.\nWe can also derive expressions for the composition of deterministic hedges.\nTheorem 17. Suppose labels L1, L2, ..., Ln are defined by prototypes P1 = P2 = ... = Pn = P , thresholds \u03b5n = f(\u03b5n\u22121), \u03b5n\u22121 = f(\u03b5n\u22122), ..., \u03b52 = f(\u03b51), where f is monotone increasing or decreasing, and that distance metric d is common to all. Then \u00b5Ln(x) = \u22061(f\n\u2212(n\u22121)(d(x, P )), where f\u2212k signifies f\u22121 composed k times.\nProof. \u00b5L2(x) = \u22061(f \u22121(d(x, P )). Suppose that \u00b5Lk(x) = \u2206k(d(x, P )) = \u22061(f \u2212(k\u22121)(d(x, P )). Since \u03b5k+1 = f(\u03b5k), we have \u00b5Lk+1(x) = \u2206k(f\n\u22121(d(x, P )) = \u22061(f\u2212k(d(x, P ))). Therefore \u00b5Ln(x) = \u22061(f \u2212(n\u22121)(d(x, P )) by induction.\nSince labels can be composed in this way, we can model different degrees of emphasis corresponding to the composition of multiple hedges. So, for example, we could model \u2018extremely L\u2019 as \u2018very, very L\u2019. This is illustrated in example 18.\nExample 18. Suppose the label L is as described in example 3, i.e. L has prototype P = 5, and threshold \u03b5 \u223c Uniform[0, 3]. We can form a new label vL with prototype Pv = P = 5 and threshold \u03b5v \u2264 \u03b5, which has appropriateness \u00b5vL(x) = \u00b5L(x) + (1 \u2212 \u00b5L(x)) ln(1 \u2212 \u00b5L(x)) as shown in theorem 4. We may then form another new label vvL with prototype Pvv = Pv = 5 and threshold \u03b5vv \u2264 \u03b5v with appropriateness \u00b5vvL(x) = \u00b5vL(x) + (1 \u2212 \u00b5vL(x)) ln(1 \u2212 \u00b5vL(x)) as described in theorem 15. The effect of applying this contraction hedge is seen in figure 12. We have contrasted the effect of the composed hedges with (\u00b5L(x)) 4.\nSince these hedges can be composed only an integral number of times, we cannot obtain the differences in grade that could be achieved with using various powers in a powering modifier, e.g. \u00b5L(x)\n1.73. However, in section 4.3 we discuss how to tune the intensity of hedges by using dependencies on functions of thresholds. We have further shown in section 4.4 how to derive powering and shifting modifiers within our framework. It would be interesting to explore how other examples of hedges can be expressed in this framework.\nWe have shown that when multiple hedges of the forms seen in theorems 2 and 4 are used, \u00b5Ln(x) can be expressed purely in terms of the appropriateness of the label directly preceding it. We have not been able to find a closed form solution for this recurrence, however, we can investigate the fixed points of the recurrence and examine what happens to the values of \u00b5Ln(x) as n\u2192\u221e. We have also shown that deterministic hedges can be composed, and we go on to look at their behaviour in the limit of composition."}, {"heading": "4.6 Limits of Compositions.", "text": "The following results examine the behaviour of \u00b5Ln(x) as n\u2192\u221e\nTheorem 19.

Again, if \u00b5L1(x) = 1 then \u00b5Li(x) = 1 \u2200i = 1, ..., n.

In the case of dilation, the crisp set includes the whole support of the fuzzy set associated with the original label, whereas in the case of contraction, the concept reduces to include only its prototype.\nWhen deterministic hedges are used, i.e. \u03b52 = f(\u03b51), the behaviour of the limit depends on the behaviour of the function f and its properties in the limit as n\u2192\u221e of f\u2212n.\nExample 21. Suppose f(\u03b5) = 0.5\u03b5. Applying this hedge multiple times will result in \u00b5Ln(x) = \u22061(2 nd(x, P )). As n\u2192\u221e, 2nd(x, P )\u2192\u221e, except where d(x, P ) = 0.

As n \u2192 \u221e, 2\u2212nd(x, P ) \u2192 0, and hence\n\u00b5L\u221e(x) = 1 \u2200x \u2208 \u2126.\nThe behaviour of the hedges given in example 21 is therefore different from those in theorems 19 and 20, since the concept either shrinks to a single point, in the case of contraction, or, in the case of dilation, expands to fill the entire space \u2126."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "We have presented formulae for linguistic hedges which are both functional and semantically grounded. The modifiers presented arise naturally from the label semantics framework, in which concepts are represented by a prototype and threshold. Our hedges have an intuitive meaning: if I think that the threshold for a concept \u2018small\u2019 is of a certain width, then the threshold for the concept \u2018very small\u2019 will be narrower. On the other hand, the threshold for the concept \u2018quite small\u2019 will be broader. The hedges proposed are examples of \u2018type 1\u2019 hedges, i.e. they operate equally across all dimensions of the fuzzy set associated with a concept. The first result presented is somewhat similar to a powering modifier since the core and support of the set remain the same. In [3, 22], it is argued that this property is undesirable for hedges used in fuzzy expert systems, since if a query is returning too large a set of answers, this type of contraction hedge does not reduce this overabundance. However, although the hedges we propose do not at their simplest address the overabundance issue, we argue that they address another problem associated with powering hedges, in that they have a clear semantic grounding that the powering modifiers lack.\n[2, 8] also propose modifiers that are semantically grounded, using the idea of resemblance to nearby objects. Their formulations have the properties that the core and support of the fuzzy set are both changed, thereby addressing the issue of overabundant answers [3, 22]. In our most specific case, since the prototype is not altered, the core and support of the fuzzy set representing the concept remain the same. However, our initial proposal can be generalised, as in section 4.2, to apply to the case where P1 6= P2. Specifying a semantically meaningful way of altering the boundaries of the prototype would answer the objection that the core and support of a set should change under a linguistic hedge.\nThe most general result (section 4.3) shows that the formula still applies when \u03b52 \u2264 f(\u03b51), or \u03b52 \u2265 f(\u03b51). Combined with a distribution \u03b4 such that the lower bound of the distribution is not zero, the core and support of the fuzzy set are modified. With the condition \u03b52 = f(\u03b51), we are able to recreate the result given in [24] for linear membership functions, and show how the model proposed by [2] has strong similarities to our own. In this case we have introduced additional parameters, so the simplicity of the original result is lost. However, the further parameters introduced are no more than those introduced by [24], and arguably fewer than those introduced by [2], who require that a resemblance relation be specified, using two additional parameters, and also, that a T -norm or fuzzy implication need to be specified. There are various choices of operator that could be used for either of these, and it is not obvious that any one is better than the others.\nWe have also shown that the basic case operators \u2018very\u2019 and \u2018quite\u2019 can be composed, which is not immediately obvious from the formulae (section 4.5). Further, we show that in the limit of composition the\nmembership of any object in the fuzzy part of L, i.e. {x : 0 < \u00b5L(x) < 1}, increases to 1 in the case of \u2018quite\u2019 or decreases to 0 in the case of \u2018very\u2019 (section 4.6). This is similar to the limit of applying the powering modifiers, but differs from what would happen with the modifiers proposed by [2]. In that case, the limit of \u2018very\u2019 would shrink to a single point and the limit of \u2018quite\u2019 would expand to encompass the whole universe of discourse. This can be modelled using the deterministic hedges described in section 4.4. Although behaviour differs slightly, in fact human discourse does not apply modifiers infinitely, so the difference in behaviour is arguably not important.\nOur formulation has the benefit that it can be applied in more situations than simply linguistic hedges. For example, the concept \u2018apple green\u2019 has a prototype different to that of just green, and the threshold for \u2018apple green\u2019 is likely to be smaller than the threshold for simply \u2018green\u2019. Our model can take account of this."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and further work", "text": "We have presented formulae for two simple linguistic hedges, \u2018very\u2019 and \u2018quite\u2019. These formulae are functional, hence easy to compute, but also semantically grounded, in that they arise naturally from the conceptual framework of label semantics combined with prototype theory and conceptual spaces theory, and in the most specific case require no additional parameters. We have also shown that two other formulations [2, 8, 24], can be derived from this framework with equal or fewer parameters. We have shown that the hedges can be composed and have described their behaviour in the limit of composition.\nFurther work could look at testing the utility of these hedges in particular classifiers to compare their performance with the classical hedges and with the hedges used by e.g. [3, 22], and also to examine a trade-off between accuracy and the number of parameters used. Alternatively, investigating semantically grounded ways of expanding or reducing prototypes could have a similar impact.\nThe model could also be extended to the more complicated type 2 hedges such as \u2018essentially\u2019, or \u2018technically\u2019, by treating dimensions of the conceptual space heterogeneously. This requires using some type of weighting or necessity measure on the dimensions, work which is currently ongoing."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgements", "text": "Martha Lewis gratefully acknowledges support from EPSRC Grant No. EP/E501214/1"}], "references": [{"title": "A fuzzy linguistic approach generalizing boolean information retrieval: A model and its evaluation", "author": ["G.
