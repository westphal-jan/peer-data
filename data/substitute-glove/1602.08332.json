In order to understand such biological intelligence and to design artificial intelligent systems, a central goal is to analyze adaptive behavior from a theoretical point of view. A formal framework to achieve this goal is decision theory. An important idea, originating from the foundations of decision theory, is the principle of maximum expected utility [1]. According to the principle of maximum expected utility, an intelligent agent is formalized as a decision-maker that chooses optimal actions that maximize the expected benefit of an outcome, where the agent\u2019s benefit is quantified by a utility function.\nA fundamental problem of the maximum expected utility principle is that it does not take into account computational resources that are necessary to identify optimal actions\u2014 it is for example computationally prohibitive to compute an optimal chess move because of the vast amount of potential board configurations. One way of taking computational resources into account is to study optimal decisionmaking under information-processing constraints [2, 3]. In this study, we use an information-theoretic model of bounded rational decision-making [4, 5, 6] that has precursors in the economic literature [7, 8, 9] and that is closely related to recent advances harnessing information theory for machine learning and perception-action systems [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].\nPreviously, this information-theoretic bounded rationality model was applied to derive a synaptic weight update rule for a single reward-maximizing spiking neuron [21]. It was shown that such a neuron tries to keep its firing rate close to its average firing rate, which ultimately leads to economizing of synaptic weights. Mathematically, such economizing is equivalent to a regularization that prevents synaptic weights from growing without bounds. The bounded rational weight update rule furthermore generalizes the synaptic weight update rule for an ordinary reward-maximizing spiking neuron as presented for example in [22]. In our current work, we extend the framework of informationtheoretic bounded rationality to networks of neurons, but restrict ourselves for a start to deterministic settings. In particular, we investigate two scenarios, where either each single neuron is considered as a bounded rational decisionmaker or the network as a whole.\nThe remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain the information-theoretic bounded rationality model that we use. In Section 3, we apply this model to derive bounded rational synaptic weight update rules for single neurons and networks of neurons. In Section 4, we demonstrate the regularizing effect of these bounded rational weight update rules on the MNIST benchmark classification task. In Section 5, we conclude.\nProceedings of the 32nd Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, New York City, NY, USA, 2016.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n08 33\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 3\nM ay\n2 01"}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND ON BOUNDED RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 A FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE FOR BOUNDED RATIONALITY", "text": "A decision-maker is faced with the task to choose an optimal action out of a set of actions. Each action y is associated with a given task-specific utility value U(y). A fully rational decision-maker picks the action y\u2217 that globally maximizes the utility function, where y\u2217 = arg maxy U(y), assuming for notational simplicity that the global maximum is unique. Under limited computational resources however, the decision-maker may not be able to identify the globally optimal action y\u2217 which leads to the question of how limited computational resources should be quantified. In general, the decision-maker\u2019s behavior can be expressed as a probability distribution over actions p(y). The basic idea of information-theoretic bounded rationality is that changes in such probability distributions are costly and necessitate computational resources. More precisely, computational resources are quantified as informational cost evoked by changing from a prior probabilistic strategy p0(y) to a posterior probabilistic strategy p(y) during the deliberation process preceding the choice. Mathematically, this informational cost is given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence DKL(p(y)||p0(y)) \u2264 B between prior and posterior strategy, where computational resources are modeled as an upper bound B \u2265 0 [10, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 8, 9]. Accordingly, bounded rational decision-making can be formalized by the following free energy objective\np\u2217(y)\n= arg max p(y) (1\u2212 \u03b2) \u3008U(y)\u3009p(y) \u2212 \u03b2DKL(p(y)||p0(y))\n= arg max p(y)\n\u2329 (1\u2212 \u03b2)U(y)\u2212 \u03b2 ln p(y)\np0(y) \u232a p(y) ,\n(1)\nwhere \u03b2 \u2208 (0; 1) controls the trade-off between expected utility and informational cost. Note that the upper bound B imposed on the Kullback-Leibler divergence determines the value of \u03b2. Choosing the value ofB is hence equivalent to choosing the value of \u03b2.\nThe free energy objective in Equation (1) is concave with respect to p(y) and the optimal solution p\u2217(y) can be expressed in closed analytic form:\np\u2217(y) = p0(y) exp( 1\u2212\u03b2 \u03b2 U(y))\u2211\ny\u2032 p0(y \u2032) exp( 1\u2212\u03b2\u03b2 U(y\n\u2032)) . (2)\nIn the limit cases of none (\u03b2 \u2192 1) and infinite (\u03b2 \u2192 0)\nresources, the optimal strategy from Equation (2) becomes\nlim \u03b2\u21921\np\u2217(y) = p0(y), (3)\nlim \u03b2\u21920\np\u2217(y) = \u03b4yy\u2217 , (4)\nrespectively, where y\u2217 = arg maxy U(y) represents an action that globally maximizes the utility function. A decision-maker without any computational resources (\u03b2 \u2192 1) sticks to its prior strategy p0(y), whereas a decisionmaker that can access an arbitrarily large amount of resources (\u03b2 \u2192 0) always picks a globally optimal action and recovers thus the fully rational decision-maker."}, {"heading": "2.2 A RATE DISTORTION PRINCIPLE FOR CONTEXT-DEPENDENT DECISION-MAKING", "text": "In the face of multiple contexts, fully rational decisionmaking requires to find an optimal action y for each environment x, where optimality is defined through a utility function U(x, y). Bounded rational decision-making in multiple contexts means to compute multiple strategies, expressed as conditional probability distributions p(y|x), under limited computational resources. Limited computational resources are modeled through an upper bound B \u2265 0 on the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence \u3008DKL(p(y|x)||p0(y))\u3009p(x) \u2264 B between the strategies p(y|x) and a common prior p0(y), averaged over all possible environments described by the distribution p(x) [4, 15]. The resulting optimization problem may be formalized as\np\u2217(y|x) = arg max p(y|x) (1\u2212 \u03b2) \u3008U(x, y)\u3009p(x,y)\n\u2212 \u03b2 \u3008DKL (p(y|x)||p0(y))\u3009p(x) , (5)\nwhere \u03b2 \u2208 (0; 1) governs the trade-off between expected utility and informational cost. It can be shown that the most economic prior p0(y) is given by the marginal distribution p0(y) = p(y) = \u2211 x p(y|x)p(x), because the marginal distribution minimizes the expected KullbackLeibler divergence for a given set of conditional distributions p(y|x)\u2014see [23]. In this case, the expected KullbackLeibler divergence becomes identical to the mutual information I(x, y) between the environment x and the action y [4, 21, 11, 12, 7, 16]. Accordingly, bounded rational decision-making can be formalized through the following objective\np\u2217(y|x) = arg max\np(y|x) (1\u2212 \u03b2) \u3008U(x, y)\u3009p(x,y) \u2212 \u03b2I(x, y)\n= arg max p(y|x)\n\u2329 (1\u2212 \u03b2)U(x, y)\u2212 \u03b2 ln p(y|x)\np(y) \u232a p(x,y) ,\n(6)\nwhich is mathematically equivalent to the rate distortion problem from information theory [24].\nThe rate distortion objective in Equation (6) is concave with respect to p(y|x) but there is unfortunately no closed analytic form solution. It is however possible to express the optimal solution as a set of self-consistent equations:\np\u2217(y|x) = p(y) exp( 1\u2212\u03b2\u03b2 U(x, y))\u2211 y\u2032 p(y \u2032) exp( 1\u2212\u03b2\u03b2 U(x, y \u2032)) , (7)\np(y) = \u2211 x p\u2217(y|x)p(x). (8)\nThese self-consistent equations are solved by replacing p(y) with an initial arbitrary distribution q(y) and iterating through Equations (7) and (8) in an alternating fashion. This procedure is known as Blahut-Arimoto algorithm [25, 26] and is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum [27] presupposed that q(y) does not assign zero probability mass to any y.\nIn the limit cases of none (\u03b2 \u2192 1) and infinite (\u03b2 \u2192 0) resources, the optimal strategy from Equations (7) and (8) may be expressed in closed analytic form\nlim \u03b2\u21921\np\u2217(y|x) = p(y) = \u03b4yy\u2217 , (9)\nlim \u03b2\u21920\np\u2217(y|x) = \u03b4yy\u2217x , (10)\nwhere y\u2217 = arg maxy \u3008U(x, y)\u3009p(x) refers to an action that globally maximizes the expected utility averaged over all possible environments, and y\u2217x refers to an action that globally maximizes the utility for one particular environment x\u2014assuming for notational simplicity that global maxima are unique in both cases. In the absence of any computational resources (\u03b2 \u2192 1), the decision-maker chooses the same strategy no matter which environment is encountered in order to minimize the deviation between the conditional strategies p(y|x) and the average strategy p(y). The decision-maker chooses however a strategy that maximizes the average expected utility. In case of access to an arbitrarily large amount of computational resources (\u03b2 \u2192 0), the decision-maker picks the best action for each environment and recovers thus the fully rational decision-maker."}, {"heading": "3 THEORETICAL RESULTS: SYNAPTIC WEIGHT UPDATE RULES", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 PARAMETERIZED STRATEGIES AND ONLINE RULES", "text": "Computing the optimal solution to the rate distortion problem in Equation (6) with help of Equations (7) and (8) through the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm has two severe drawbacks. First, it requires to compute and store the conditional strategies p(y|x) and the marginal strategy p(y) explicitly, which is prohibitive for large environment and action spaces. And second, it requires that the decisionmaker is able to evaluate the utility function for arbitrary\nenvironment-action pairs (x, y), which is a plausible assumption in planning, but not in reinforcement learning where samples from the utility function can only be obtained from interactions with the environment.\nWe therefore assume a parameterized form of the strategy pw(y|x), from which the decision-maker can draw samples y for a given sample of the environment x, and optimize the rate distortion objective from Equation (6) with help of gradient ascent [21]\u2014also referred to as policy gradient in the reinforcement learning literature [22]. Gradient ascent requires to compute the derivative of the objective function L(w) with respect to the strategy parameters w and to update the parameters according to the rule w \u2190 w + \u03b1 \u00b7 \u2202\u2202wL(w) in each time step, where \u03b1 > 0 denotes the learning rate and \u2202\u2202wL(w) is defined as\n\u2202\n\u2202w L(w) =\u2329( \u2202\n\u2202w ln pw(y|x)\n) (1\u2212 \u03b2)U(x, y) \u232a pw(x,y)\n\u2212 \u2329( \u2202\n\u2202w ln pw(y|x)\n) \u03b2 ln\npw(y|x) pw(y) \u232a pw(x,y) . (11)\nNote that the update rule from Equation (11) requires the computation of an expected value over pw(x, y). This expected value can be approximated through environmentaction samples (x, y) in either a batch or an online manner. For the rest of this paper, we assume an online update rule where the agent adapts its behavior instantaneously after each interaction with the environment in response to an immediate reward signal U(x, y) as is typical for reinforcement learning.\nInformally, the rate distortion model for bounded rational decision-making translates into a specific form of regularization that penalizes deviations of the decision-maker\u2019s instantaneous strategy pw(y|x), given the current environment x, from the decision-maker\u2019s mean strategy pw(y) =\u2211 x pw(y|x)p(x), averaged over all possible environments. Previously, Equation (11) was applied to a single spiking neuron that was stochastic [21]. Here, we generalize this approach to deterministic networks of neurons that have neural input (environmental context x), neural output (action y) and a reward signal (utility U ). We derive parameter update rules in the style of Equation (11) that allow to adjust synaptic weights in an online fashion. In particular, we investigate two scenarios where either each single neuron is considered as a bounded rational decision-maker or the network as a whole."}, {"heading": "3.2 A STOCHASTIC NEURON AS A BOUNDED RATIONAL DECISION-MAKER", "text": "A stochastic neuron may be considered as a bounded rational decision-maker [21]: the neuron\u2019s presynaptic input is\ninterpreted as environmental context and the neuron\u2019s output is interpreted as action variable.

In a similar way, the neuron\u2019s mean firing behavior can be expressed as:\npw(y) = y \u00b7 \u03c1\u0304(w) + (1\u2212 y) \u00b7 (1\u2212 \u03c1\u0304(w)), (13)\nwhere \u03c1\u0304(w) = \u2211\nx \u03c1(w >x)p(x) denotes the neuron\u2019s\nmean firing probability averaged over all possible inputs x.

If the conditional and marginal strategies are initialized to be roughly equal pw0(y) \u2248 pw0(y|x), where w0 \u2248 0 refers to the initial value of w, the hyperparameter \u03b2 determines how fast the decisionmaker\u2019s strategy converges. A high value of \u03b2 implies little computational resources and quick convergence due to the fact that conditional and marginal strategies are initially almost equal.

In particular, we investigated in how far this information-theoretically motivated regularization subserves generalization. To this end, we trained classification on the MNIST training set, consisting of 60, 000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, and tested generalization on\nthe MNIST test set, consisting of 10, 000 examples. For all our simulations, we used a network with two hidden layers of rectified linear units [29] and a top layer of 10 softmax units implemented in Lua with Torch [30]. We chose as optimization criterion the negative cross entropy between the class labels and the network output [31]\nU(\u03be, f(W, \u03be)) = \u2211 j \u03b4jl(\u03be) ln fj(W, \u03be), (32)\nwhere \u03b4 denotes the Kronecker delta and \u03be the vectorized input image\u2014note that pixels were normalized to lie in the range [0; 1]. The variable j \u2208 {1, 10} is an index over the network\u2019s output units and l(\u03be) \u2208 {1, 10} denotes the label of image \u03be.\nIn order to assess the robustness of our regularizers, we performed our experiments with networks of different architectures. In particular, we used network architectures with two hidden layers and varied the number of neurons #neu \u2208 {529, 1024, 2025, 4096} per hidden layer. We performed gradient ascent with a learning rate \u03b1 = 0.01 updating weights online after each training example. We trained the networks for 70 epochs where one epoch corresponded to one sweep through the entire training set. After each epoch, the learning rate decayed according to \u03b1 \u2190 \u03b11+t\u00b7\u03b7 where t denotes the current epoch and \u03b7 = 0.002 is a decay parameter. Weights were updated by use of a momentum \u03b3 = 0.9 according to \u2206wni \u2190 \u03b3\u2206wni +(1\u2212\u03b3) \u2202\u2202wni L(W) and were randomly initialized in the range (\u2212(#in(n))\u22120.5; (#in(n))\u22120.5) with help of a uniform distribution at the beginning of the simulation where #in(n) denotes the number of inputs to neuron n. Each non-input neuron had an additional bias weight that was initialized in the same way as the presynaptic weights of that neuron. Rate distortion regularization required furthermore to compute the mean firing rate \u03c6\u0304(wn) of individual neurons n through an exponential window in an online fashion with a time constant \u03c4 = 1000. In order to ensure numerical stability when using rate distortion regularization, terms of the form ln \u03c6(w n>\u03ben)\n\u03c6\u0304(wn) in the weight update rules were computed according to ln max{\u03c6(wn>\u03ben), \u03b5} \u2212 ln max{\u03c6\u0304(wn), \u03b5} with \u03b5 = 2.22 \u00b7 10\u221216.\nTo find optimal values for the rate distortion trade-off parameter \u03b2, we conducted pilot studies with small networks comprising 529 neurons per hidden layer that were trained for only 50 epochs on the MNIST training set according to the aforementioned training scheme and subsequently evaluated on the MNIST test set. While this might induce overfitting of \u03b2 on the test set in the small networks, we used the same \u03b2-values as a heuristic for all larger architectures and did not tune the hyperparameter any further. In global rate distortion regularization (Grdi), the best test error was achieved around \u03b2 = 0.2 although Grdi seems to behave rather robust in the range \u03b2 \u2208 [0; 0.8]\u2014see middle\nleft panel in Figure 1. In local rate distortion regularization (Lrdi), the best test error was achieved for \u03b2 = 0 with ordinary utility maximization without regularization\u2014see middle right panel. However, when measuring the performance in terms of expected utility on the test set, Lrdi achieved a significant performance increase compared to ordinary utility maximization in the range \u03b2 \u2208 [10\u22125, 5\u00b710\u22124]\u2014see upper right panel. In our final studies, we could furthermore ascertain that Lrdi performs reasonably well on larger architectures as it achieved a test error of 1.26% compared to 1.43% in ordinary utility maximization when increasing the number of units per hidden layer to 4096.\nThe results of our final studies where we trained networks for 70 epochs are illustrated in Table 1 which compares rate distortion regularization to other techniques from the literature for different network architectures comprising two hidden layers. It can be seen that both local and global rate distortion regularization (Lrdi and Grdi respectively) attain results in the permutation invariant setting (Lrdi: 1,26%, Grdi: 1.11%) that are competitive with other recent techniques like dropout (1.01% [33] and 1.28% [32]), dropconnect (1.20% [32]) and Bayes by backprop (1.32% [10]). It is furthermore shown that both rate distortion regularizers lead to a decreasing generalization error when increasing the number of neurons in hidden layers which demonstrates successful prevention of overfitting. Successful prevention of overfitting is additionally demonstrated by applying global rate distortion regularization (Grid, \u03b2 = 0.2) to a convolutional neural network with an architecture according to [32]\u2014see Section B.2 in [32]\u2014attaining an error of 0.61% without tuning any hyperparameters (see Table 2). This result is also competitive with other recent techniques in the permutation non-invariant setting\u2014 compare to dropout (0.59% [32]) and dropconnect (0.63% [32]). In line with [33], we preprocessed the input with ZCA whitening and added a max-norm regularizer to limit the size of presynaptic weight vectors to at most 3.5.\nThe lower panels of Figure 1 show the development of the test set error over epochs for both rate distortion regularizers (red) compared to ordinary utility maximization without regularization (Umax, black) for the different network architectures that we used in the permutation invariant setting. It can be seen that the global variant of our regularizer (Grdi with \u03b2 = 0.2, see lower left panel in Figure 1) leads to a significant increase in performance across different architectures as demonstrated by the two separate clusters of trajectories. In addition, Grdi also leads to faster learning as the red trajectories in the lower left panel of Figure 1 decrease significantly faster then the black trajectories during the first ten epochs of training. For the local variant of our regularizer (Lrdi with \u03b2 = 10\u22125, see lower right panel in Figure 1), the performance improvements are less prominent when compared to the global variant."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "Previously, a synaptic weight update rule for a single reward-maximizing spiking neuron was devised, where the neuron was interpreted as a bounded rational decisionmaker under limited computational resources with help of rate distortion theory [21]. It was shown that such a bounded rational weight update rule leads to an efficient regularization by preventing synaptic weights from growing without bounds. In our current work, we extend these results to deterministic neurons and neural networks. On the MNIST benchmark classification task, we have demonstrated the regularizing effect of our approach as networks were successfully prevented from overfitting. These results are robust as we conducted experiments with different network architectures achieving performance competitive with other recent techniques like dropout [33], dropconnect [32] and Bayes by backprop [10] for both ordinary and convolutional networks. The strength of rate distortion regularization is that it is a more principled approach than for example dropout and dropconnect as it may be applied to general artificial agents with parameterized policies and not only to neural networks. Parameterized policies that optimize the rate distortion objective have been previously applied to unsupervised density estimation tasks with autoencoder networks [12]. Our current work extends this kind of approach to the theory of reinforcement and supervised learning with feedforward neural networks, and also provides evidence that this approach scales well on large data sets."}, {"heading": "A APPENDIX", "text": "A.1 MUTUAL INFORMATION RATE OF A DETERMINISTIC NEURON\nlim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t I(\u03be, y)\n= lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t \u2329\u2211 y pw(y|\u03be) ln pw(y|\u03be) pw(y) \u232a p(\u03be)\n= lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t\n\u2329 \u03c6(w>\u03be)\u2206t ln \u03c6(w>\u03be)\n\u03c6\u0304(w) \u232a p(\u03be)\n+ lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t\n\u2329 (1\u2212 \u03c6(w>\u03be)\u2206t) ln 1\u2212 \u03c6(w >\u03be)\u2206t\n1\u2212 \u03c6\u0304(w)\u2206t\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u21920 \u232a p(\u03be)\n= \u2329 \u03c6(w>\u03be) ln \u03c6(w>\u03be)\n\u03c6\u0304(w) \u232a p(\u03be) .\n(33)\nA.2 DERIVATIVE OF THE MUTUAL INFORMATION RATE\n\u2202\n\u2202wi lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t I(\u03be, y)\n= lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t\n\u2202\n\u2202wi \u2329\u2211 y pw(y|\u03be) ln pw(y|\u03be) pw(y) \u232a p(\u03be)\n= lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t \u2329\u2211 y ( \u2202 \u2202wi pw(y|\u03be) ) ln pw(y|\u03be) pw(y) \u232a p(\u03be)\n+ lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t \u2329\u2211 y pw(y|\u03be) ( \u2202 \u2202wi ln pw(y|\u03be) )\u232a p(\u03be)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n= \u2329\u2211\ny \u2202 \u2202wi pw(y|\u03be) \u232a p(\u03be) = \u2202\u2202wi 1=0\n\u2212 lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t \u2329\u2211 y pw(y|\u03be) ( \u2202 \u2202wi ln pw(y) )\u232a p(\u03be)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n= \u2211\ny \u2202\n\u2202wi pw(y)= \u2202 \u2202wi 1=0\n= lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t\n\u2329 \u03bei\u03c6 \u2032(w>\u03be)\u2206t ln \u03c6(w>\u03be)\n\u03c6\u0304(w) \u232a p(\u03be)\n\u2212 lim \u2206t\u21920\n1\n\u2206t\n\u2329 \u03bei\u03c6 \u2032(w>\u03be)\u2206t ln\n1\u2212 \u03c6(w>\u03be)\u2206t 1\u2212 \u03c6\u0304(w)\u2206t\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u21920 \u232a p(\u03be)\n= \u2329 \u03bei\u03c6 \u2032(w>\u03be) ln \u03c6(w>\u03be)\n\u03c6\u0304(w) \u232a p(\u03be) .\n(34)\nA.3 DERIVATIVE OF THE GLOBAL MUTUAL INFORMATION\n\u2202\n\u2202wni I(\u03be,y)\n= \u2202\n\u2202wni \u2329\u2211 y pW(y|\u03be) ln pW(y|\u03be) pW(y) \u232a p(\u03be)\n= \u2329\u2211 y ( \u2202 \u2202wni pW(y|\u03be) ) ln pW(y|\u03be) pW(y) \u232a p(\u03be)\n+ \u2329\u2211 y pW(y|\u03be) ( \u2202 \u2202wni ln pW(y|\u03be) )\u232a p(\u03be)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n= \u2329\u2211\ny \u2202 \u2202wn i pW(y|\u03be) \u232a p(\u03be) = \u2202 \u2202wn i 1=0\n\u2212 \u2329\u2211 y pW(y|\u03be) ( \u2202 \u2202wni ln pW(y) )\u232a p(\u03be)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n= \u2211\ny \u2202\n\u2202wn i pW(y)=\n\u2202 \u2202wn\ni 1=0\n= \u2329\u2211 j ( \u2202 \u2202wni fj(W, \u03be) ) ln fj(W, \u03be) f\u0304j(W) \u232a p(\u03be) .\n(35)"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This study was supported by the DFG, Emmy Noether grant BR4164/1-1."}], "references": [{"title": "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior", "author": ["J von Neumann", "O Morgenstern"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 1944}, {"title": "Computational rationality: a converging paradigm for intelligence in brains", "author": ["S J Gershman", "E J Horvitz", "J B Tenenbaum"], "venue": "minds, and machines.

under limited computational resources. Mathematically, such decision-makers can be modeled as informationtheoretic channels with limited transmission rate. Here, we apply this formalism for the first time to multilayer feedforward neural networks. We derive synaptic weight update rules for two scenarios, where either each neuron is considered as a bounded rational decision-maker or the network as a whole. In the update rules, bounded rationality translates into information-theoretically motivated types of regularization in weight space. In experiments on the MNIST benchmark classification task for handwritten digits, we show that such information-theoretic regularization successfully prevents overfitting across different architectures and attains results that are competitive with other recent techniques like dropout, dropconnect and Bayes by backprop, for both ordinary and convolutional neural networks.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
