WSD is useful for a range of NLP tasks, including information retrieval, information extraction, machine translation, content analysis, and lexicography (see Navigli (2009) for an overview).\nStandard WSD disambiguates words based on their textual context; however, in a multimodal setting (e.g., newspaper articles with photographs), visual context is also available and can be used for disambiguation. Based on this observation, we introduce a new task, visual sense disambiguation (VSD) for verbs: given an image and a verb, assign the correct sense of the verb, i.e., the one depicted in the image. While VSD approaches for nouns exist, VSD for verbs is a novel, more challenging task, and related in interesting ways to action recognition in computer vision. As an example consider the verb play, which can have the senses participate in sport, play on an instrument, and be engaged in playful activity, depending on its visual context, see Figure 1.\nWe expect visual sense disambiguation to be useful for multimodal tasks such as image retrieval. As an example consider the output of Google Image Search for the query sit: it recognizes that the verb has multiple senses and tries to cluster relevant images. However, the result does not capture the polysemy of the verb well, and would clearly benefit from VSD (see Figure 2).\nVisual sense disambiguation has previously been attempted for nouns (e.g., apple can mean fruit or computer), which is a substantially easier task that can be solved with the help of an object detector\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n09 18\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 M\nar 2\n(Barnard et al., 2003; Loeff et al., 2006; Saenko and Darrell, 2008; Chen et al., 2015). VSD for nouns is helped by resources such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), a large image database containing 1.4 million images for 21,841 noun synsets and organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. However, we are not aware of any previous work on VSD for verbs, and no ImageNet for verbs exists. Not only image retrieval would benefit from VSD for verbs, but also other multimodal tasks that have recently received a lot of interest, such as automatic image description and visual question answering (Karpathy and Li, 2015; Fang et al., 2015; Antol et al., 2015).\nIn this work, we explore the new task of visual sense disambiguation for verbs: given an image and a verb, assign the correct sense of the verb, i.e., the one that describes the action depicted in the image. We present VerSe, a new dataset that augments existing multimodal datasets (COCO and TUHOI) with sense labels. VerSe contains 3518 images, each annotated with one of 90 verbs, and the OntoNotes sense realized in the image. We propose an algorithm based on the Lesk WSD algorithm in order to perform unsupervised visual sense disambiguation on our dataset. We focus in particular on how to best represent word senses for visual disambiguation, and explore the use of textual, visual, and multimodal embeddings. Textual embeddings for a given image can be constructed over object labels or image descriptions, which are available as gold-standard in the COCO and TUHOI datasets, or can be computed automatically using object detectors and image description models.\nOur results show that textual embeddings perform best when gold-standard textual annotations are available, while multimodal embeddings perform best when automatically generated object labels are used. Interestingly, we find that automatically generated image descriptions result in inferior performance."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "There is an extensive literature on word sense disambiguation for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Most of these approaches rely on lexical databases or sense inventories such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) or OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Unsupervised WSD approaches often rely on distributional representations, computed over the target word and its context (Lin, 1997; McCarthy et al., 2004; Brody and Lapata, 2008). Most supervised approaches use sense annotated corpora to extract linguistic features of the target word (context words, POS tags, collocation features), which are then fed into a classifier to disambiguate test data (Zhong and Ng, 2010). Recently, features based on sense-specific semantic vectors learned using large corpora and a sense inventory such as WordNet have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for supervised WSD (Rothe and Schutze, 2015; Jauhar et al., 2015).\nAs mentioned in the introduction, all existing work on visual sense disambiguation has used nouns, starting with Barnard et al. (2003). Sense discrimination for web images was introduced by Loeff et al. (2006), who used spectral clustering over multimodal features from the images and web text. Saenko and Darrell (2008) used sense definitions in a dictionary to learn a latent LDA space overs senses, which they then used to construct sensespecific classifiers by exploiting the text surrounding an image."}, {"heading": "2.1 Related Datasets", "text": "Most of the datasets relevant for verb sense disambiguation were created by the computer vision community for the task of human action recognition (see\nTable 1 for an overview). These datasets are annotated with a limited number of actions, where an action is conceptualized as verb-object pair: ride horse, ride bicycle, play tennis, play guitar, etc. Verb sense ambiguity is ignored in almost all action recognition datasets, which misses important generalizations: for instance, the actions ride horse and ride bicycle represent the same sense of ride and thus share visual, textual, and conceptual features, while this is not the case for play tennis and play guitar. This is the issue we address by creating a dataset with explicit sense labels.\nVerSe is built on top of two existing datasets, TUHOI and COCO. The Trento Universal HumanObject Interaction (TUHOI) dataset contains 10,805 images covering 2974 actions. Action (humanobject interaction) categories were annotated using crowdsourcing: each image was labeled by multiple annotators with a description in the form of a verb or a verb-object pair. The main drawback of TUHOI is that 1576 out of 2974 action categories occur only once, limiting its usefulness for VSD. The Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is very popular in the language/vision community, as it consists of over 120k images with extensive annotation, including labels for 91 object categories and five descriptions per image. COCO contains no explicit action annotation, but verbs and verb phrases can be extracted from the descriptions. (But note that not all the COCO images depict actions.)\nThe recently created Humans Interacting with Common Objects (HICO) dataset is conceptually similar to VerSe. It consists of 47774 images annotated with 111 verbs and 600 human-object interaction categories. Unlike other existing datasets, HICO uses sense-based distinctions: actions are denoted by sense-object pairs, rather than by verb-object pairs. HICO doesn\u2019t aim for complete coverage, but restricts itself to the top three WordNet senses of a verb. The dataset would be suitable for performing visual sense disambiguation, but has so far not been used in this way."}, {"heading": "3 VerSe Dataset and Annotation", "text": "We want to build an unsupervised visual sense disambiguation system, i.e., a system that takes an image and a verb and returns the correct sense of the verb. As discussed in Section 2.1, most exist-\ning datasets are not suitable for this task, as they do not include word sense annotation. We therefore develop our own dataset with gold-standard sense annotation. The Verb Sense (VerSe) dataset is based on COCO and TUHOI and covers 90 verbs and around 3500 images. VerSe serves two main purposes: (1) to show the feasibility of annotating images with verb senses (rather than verbs or actions); (2) to function as test bed for evaluating automatic visual sense disambiguation methods.\nVerb Selection Action recognition datasets often use a limited number of verbs (see Table 1). We addressed this issue by using images that come with descriptions, which in the case of action images typically contain verbs. The COCO dataset includes images in the form of sentences, the TUHOI dataset is annotated with verbs or prepositional verb phrases for a given object (e.g., sit on chair), which we use in lieu of descriptions. We extracted all verbs from all the descriptions in the two datasets and then selected those verbs that have more than one sense in the OntoNotes dictionary, which resulted in 148 verbs in total (94 from COCO and 133 from TUHOI).\nDepictability Annotation A verb can have multiple senses, but not all of them may be depictable, e.g., senses describing cognitive and perception processes. Consider two senses of touch: make physical contact is depictable, whereas affect emotionally describes a cognitive process and is not depictable. We therefore need to annotate the synsets of a verb as depictable or non-depictable. Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers were presented with the definitions of all the synsets of a verb, along with ex-\namples, as given by OntoNotes. An example for this annotation is shown in Figure 3. We used OntoNotes instead of WordNet, as WordNet senses are very fine-grained and potentially make depictability and sense annotation (see below) harder. Granularity issues with WordNet for text-based WSD are well documented (Navigli, 2009).\nOntoNotes lists a total of 921 senses for our 148 target verbs. For each synset, three AMT workers selected all depictable senses. The majority label was used as the gold standard for subsequent experiments. This resulted in a 504 depictable senses. Inter-annotator agreement (ITA) as measured by Fleiss\u2019 Kappa was 0.645.\nSense Annotation We then annotated a subset of the images in COCO and TUHOI with verb senses. For every image we assigned the verb that occurs most frequently in the descriptions for that image (for TUHOI, the descriptions are verb-object pairs, see above). However, many verbs are represented by only a few images, while a few verbs are represented by a large number of images. The datasets therefore show a Zipfian distribution of linguistic units, which is expected and has been observed previously for COCO (Ronchi and Perona, 2015). For sense annotation, we selected only verbs for which either COCO or TUHOI contained five or more images, resulting in a set of 90 verbs (out of the total 148). All images for these verbs were included, giving us a dataset of 3518 images: 2340 images for 82 verbs from COCO and 1188 images for 61 verbs from TUHOI (some verbs occur in both datasets).\nThese image-verb pairs formed the basis for sense annotation. AMT workers were presented with the image and all the depictable OntoNotes senses of the associated verb. The workers had to chose the sense of the verb that was instantiated in the image (or \u201cnone of the above\u201d, in the case of irrelevant images). Annotators were given sense definitions and examples, as for the depictability annotation (see Figure 3). For every image-verb pair, five annotators\nperformed the sense annotation task. A total of 157 annotators participated, reaching an inter-annotator agreement of 0.659 (Fleiss\u2019 Kappa). Out of 3528 images, we discarded 18 images annotated with \u201cnone of the above\u201d, resulting in a set of 3510 images covering 90 verbs and 163 senses. We present statistics of our dataset in Table 2; we group the verbs into motion verbs and non-motion verb using Levin (1993) classes."}, {"heading": "4 Visual Sense Disambiguation", "text": "For our disambiguation task, we assume we have a set of images I, and a set of polysemous verbs V and each image i \u2208 I is paired with a verb v \u2208 V . For example, Figure 1 shows different images paired with the verb play. Every verb v \u2208 V , has a set of senses S(v), described in a dictionary D . Now given an image i paired with a verb v, our task is to predict the correct sense s\u0302 \u2208 S(v), i.e., the sense that is depicted by the associated image. Formulated as a scoring task, disambiguation consists of finding the maximum over a suitable scoring function \u03a6:\ns\u0302 = argmax s\u2208S(v) \u03a6(s, i,v,D) (1)\nFor example, in Figure 1, the correct sense for the first image is participate in sport, for the second one it is play on an instrument, etc.\nThe Lesk (1986) algorithm is a well known knowledge-based approach to WSD which relies on the calculation of the word overlap between the sense definition and the context in which a word occurs. It is therefore an unsupervised approach, i.e., it does not require sense-annotated training data, but instead exploits resources such as dictionaries or ontologies to infer the sense of a word in context. Lesk uses the following scoring function to disambiguate the sense of a verb v:\n\u03a6(s,v,D) = |context(v)\u2229definition(s,D)| (2)\nHere, context(v) the set of words that occur close the target word v and definition(s,D) is the set of words in the definition of sense s in the dictionary D . Lesk\u2019s approach is very sensitive to the exact wording of definitions and results are known to change dramatically for different sets of definitions (Navigli, 2009). Also, sense definitions are often very\nshort and do not provide sufficient vocabulary or context.\nWe propose a new variant of the Lesk algorithm to disambiguate the verb sense that is depicted in an image. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of textual, visual and multimodal representations in conjunction with Lesk. An overview of our methodology is given in Figure 4. For a given image i labeled with verb v (here play), we create a representation (the vector i), which can be text-based (using the object labels and descriptions for i), visual, or multimodal. Similarly, we create text-based, visual, and multimodal representations (the vector s) for every sense s of a verb. Based on the representations i and s (detailed below), we can then score senses as:1\n\u03a6(s,v, i,D) = i \u00b7 s (3)\nNote that this approach is unsupervised: it requires no sense annotated training data; we will use the sense annotations in our VerSe dataset only for evaluation."}, {"heading": "4.1 Sense Representations", "text": "For each candidate verb sense, we create a textbased sense representation st and a visual sense representation sc.\nText-based Sense Representation We create a vector st for every sense s \u2208 S(v) of a verb v from its definition and the example usages provided in\n1Taking the dot product of two normalized vectors is equivalent to using cosine as similarity measure. We experimented with other similarity measures, but cosine performed best.\nthe OntoNotes dictionary D . We apply word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), a widely used model of word embeddings, to obtain a vector for every content word in the definition and examples of the sense. We then take the average of these vectors to compute an overall representation of the verb sense. For our experiments we used the pre-trained 300 dimensional vectors available with the word2vec package (trained on part of Google News dataset, about 100 billion words).\nVisual Sense Representation Sense dictionaries typically provide sense definitions and example sentences, but no visual examples or images. For nouns, this is remedied by ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), which provides a large number of example images for a subset of the senses in the WordNet noun hierarchy. However, no comparable resource is available for verbs (see Section 2.1).\nIn order to obtain visual sense representation sc, we therefore collected sense-specific images for the verbs in our dataset. For each verb sense s, three trained annotators were presented with the definition and examples from OntoNotes, and had to formulate a query Q (s) that would retrieve images depicting the verb sense when submitted to a search engine. For every query q we retrieved images I (q) using Bing image search (for examples, see Figure 5). We used the top 50 images returned by Bing for every query.\nOnce we have images for every sense, we can turn these images into feature representations us-\ning a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, we used the VGG 16-layer architecture (VGGNet) trained on 1.2M images of the 1000 class ILSVRC 2012 object classification dataset, a subset of ImageNet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014). This CNN model has a top-5 classification error of 7.4% on ILSVRC 2012. We use the publicly available reference model implemented using CAFFE (Jia et al., 2014) to extract the output of the fc7 layer, i.e., a 4096 dimensional vector ci, for every image i. We perform mean pooling over all the images extracted using all the queries of a sense to generate a single visual sense representation sc (shown in Equation 4):\nsc = 1 n \u2211q j\u2208Q (s) \u2211 i\u2208I (q j) ci (4)\nwhere n is the total number of images retrieved per sense s."}, {"heading": "4.2 Image Representations", "text": "We first explore the possibility of representing the image indirectly, viz., through text associated with it in the form of object labels or image descriptions (as shown in Figure 4). We experiment with two different forms of textual annotation: GOLD annotation, where object labels and descriptions are provided by human annotators, and predicted (PRED) annotation, where state-of-the-art object recognition and image description generation systems are applied to the image.\nObject Labels (O) GOLD object annotations are provided with the two datasets we use. Each image sampled from COCO is annotated with one or more of 91 object categories. Each image from TUHOI is annotated with one more of 189 object categories. PRED object annotations were generated using the same VGG-16-layer CNN object recognition model that was used to compute visual sense representations. Only object labels with object detection threshold of t > 0.2 were used.\nDescriptions (C) To obtain GOLD image descriptions, we used the used human-generated descriptions that come with COCO. For TUHOI images, we generated descriptions of the form subject-verbobject, where the subject is always person, and the verb-object pairs are the action labels that come with TUHOI. To obtain PRED descriptions, we generated\nthree descriptions for every image using the stateof-the-art image description system of Vinyals et al. (2015).2\nWe can now create a textual representation it of the image i. Again, we used word2vec to obtain word embeddings, but applied these to the object labels and to the words in the image descriptions. An overall representation of the image is then computed by averaging these vectors over all labels, all content words in the description, or both.\nCreating a visual representation ic of an image i is straightforward: we extract the fc7 layer of the VGG-16 network when applied to the image and use the resulting vector as our image representation (same setup as in Section 4.1).\nApart from experimenting with separate textual and visual representations of images, it also makes sense to combine the two modalities into a multimodal representation. The simplest approach is a concatenation model which appends textual and visual features. More complex multimodal vectors can be created using methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) (Hardoon et al., 2004; Andrew et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015). CCA allows us to find a latent space in which the linear projections of text and image vectors are maximally correlated (Gong et al., 2014; Hodosh et al., 2015). DCCA can be seen as non-linear version of CCA and has been successfully applied to image description task (Yan and Mikolajczyk, 2015), outperforming previous approaches, including kernel-based CCA.\nWe use both CCA and DCCA to map the vectors it and ic (which have different dimensions) into a joint latent space of n dimensions. We represent the projected vectors of textual and visual features for image i as it\u2032 and ic\u2032 and combine them to obtain multimodal representation im as follows:\nim = \u03bbt it \u2032 +\u03bbcic\u2032 (5)\nWe experimented with a number of parameter settings for \u03bbt and \u03bbc for textual and visual models respectively. We use the same model to combine the multimodal representation for sense s as follows:\nsm = \u03bbtst \u2032 +\u03bbcsc\u2032 (6)\n2We used Karpathy\u2019s implementation, publicly available at https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk.\nWe use these vectors (it, st), (ic, sc) and (im, sm) as described in Equation 3 to perform sense disambiguation."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1 Unsupervised Setup", "text": "To train the CCA and DCCA models, we use the text representations learned from image descriptions of COCO and Flickr30k dataset as one view and the VGG-16 features from the respective images as the second view. We divide the data into train, test and development samples (using a 80/10/10 split). We observed that the correlation scores for DCCA model were better than for the CCA model. We use the trained models to generate the projected representations of text and visual features for the images in VerSe. Once the textual and visual features are projected, we then merge them to get the multimodal representation. We experimented with different ways of combining visual and textual features projected using CCA or DCCA: (1) weighted interpolation of textual and visual features (see Equations 5 and 6), and (2) concatenating the vectors of textual and visual features.\nTo evaluate our proposed method, we compare against the first sense heuristic, which defaults to the sense listed first in the dictionary (where senses are typically ordered by frequency). This is a strong baseline which is known to outperform more complex models in traditional text-based WSD. In VerSe we observe skewness in the distribution of the senses and the first sense heuristic is as strong as over text. Also the most frequent sense heuristic, which assigns the most frequently annotated sense for a given verb in VerSe, shows very strong performance. It is supervised (as it requires sense annotated data to obtain the frequencies), so it should be regarded as an upper limit on the performance of the unsupervised methods we propose (also, in text-based WSD, the most frequent sense heuristic is considered an upper limit, Navigli (2009))."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Results", "text": "In Table 3, we summarize the results of the goldstandard (GOLD) and predicted (PRED) settings for motion and non-motion verbs across representations. In the GOLD setting we find that for both types of verbs, textual representations based on im-\nage descriptions (C) outperform visual representations (CNN features). The text-based results compare favorably to the original Lesk (as described in Equation 2), which performs at 30.7 for motion verbs and 36.2 for non-motion verbs in the GOLD setting. This improvement is clearly due to the use of word2vec embeddings.3 Note that CNN-based visual features alone performed better than goldstandard object labels alone in the case of motion verbs.\nWe also observed that adding visual features to textual features improves performance in some cases: multimodal features perform better than textual features alone both for object labels (CNN+O) and for image descriptions (CNN+C). However, adding CNN features to textual features based on object labels and descriptions together (CNN+O+C) resulted in a small decrease in performance. Furthermore, we note that CCA models outperform simple vector concatenation in case of GOLD setting for motion verbs, and overall DCCA performed considerably worse than concatenation. Note that for CCA and DCCA we report the best performing scores achieved using weighted interpolation of textual and visual features with weights \u03bbt = 0.5 and \u03bbc = 0.5.\nWhen comparing to our baseline and upper limit, we find that the all the GOLD models which use descriptions-based representations (except DCCA) outperform to the first sense heuristic for motionverbs (accuracy 70.8), whereas they performed below the first sense heuristic in case of non-motion verbs (accuracy 80.6). As expected, both motion and non-motion verbs performed significantly below the most frequent sense heuristic (accuracy 86.2 and 90.7 respectively), which we argued provides an upper limit for unsupervised approaches.\nWe now turn the PRED configuration, i.e., to results obtained using object labels and image descriptions predicted by state-of-the-art automatic systems. This is arguably the more realistic scenario, as it only requires images as input, rather than assuming human-generated object labels and image descriptions (though object detection and image description systems are required instead). In the PRED setting, we find that textual features based on ob-\n3We also experimented with Glove vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) but observed that word2vec representations consistently achieved better results that Glove vectors.\nject labels (O) outperform both first sense heuristic and textual features based on image descriptions (C) in the case of motion verbs. Combining textual and visual features via concatenation improves performance for both motion and non-motion verbs. The overall best performance of 72.6 for predicted features is obtained by combining CNN features and embeddings based on object labels and outperforms first sense heuristic in case of motion verbs (accuracy 70.8). In the PRED setting for both classes of verbs the simpler concatenation model performed better than the more complex CCA and DCCA models. Note that for CCA and DCCA we report the best performing scores achieved using weighted interpolation of textual and visual features with weights \u03bbt = 0.3 and \u03bbc = 0.7. Overall, our findings are consistent with the intuition that motion verbs are easier to disambiguate than non-motion verbs, as they are\nmore depictable and more likely to involve objects. Note that this is also reflected in the higher interannotator agreement for motion verbs (see Table 2)."}, {"heading": "5.2 Supervised Experiments and Results", "text": "Along with the unsupervised experiments we investigated the performance of textual and visual representations of images in a simplest supervised setting.

Similar to our unsupervised experiments we explore multimodal features by using both textual and visual features for classification (similar to concatenation in unsupervised experiments).\nIn Table 4 we report accuracy scores for 19 motion verbs using a supervised logistic regression classifier and for comparison we also report the scores of our proposed unsupervised algorithm for both GOLD and PRED setting. Similarly in Table 5 we report the accuracy scores for 19 non-motion verbs. We observe that all supervised classifiers for both motion and non-motion verbs performing better than first sense baseline. Similar to our findings using an unsupervised approach we find that in most cases multimodal features obtained using concatenating textual and visual features has outperformed textual or visual features alone especially in the PRED setting which is arguably the more realistic scenario.

Just as textual word sense disambiguation is useful for a wide range of NLP tasks, visual sense disambiguation can be useful for multimodal tasks such as image retrieval, image description, and text illustration. We introduce VerSe, a new dataset that augments existing multimodal datasets (COCO and TUHOI) with sense labels. We propose an unsupervised algorithm based on Lesk which performs visual sense disambiguation using textual, visual, or multimodal embeddings. We find that textual embeddings perform well when goldstandard textual annotations (object labels and image descriptions) are available, while multimodal embeddings perform well on unannotated images. We also verify our findings by using the textual and multimodal embeddings as features in a supervised setting and analyse the performance of visual sense disambiguation task.
