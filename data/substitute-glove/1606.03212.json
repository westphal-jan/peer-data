{"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "First and foremost I want to thank my advisor Animashree Anandkumar, who has been my role model as a successful female professor in machine learning. It has been an honor to be her first Ph.D. student. I appreciate all the efforts she put to help build my confidence, guide me through my early research career, and make my graduate study experience productive and stimulating. Her endless enthusiasm for research has been contagious and a source of motivation. She has also continually and convincingly conveyed a spirit of adventure with regard to research and scholarship. Anima is not only a role model, a career guide but also a friend who shares life experience and offers excellent advice. I couldn\u2019t have fought through the tough times in my Ph.D. pursuit without her inspiration or support.\nDuring my graduate studies, I have been lucky to have collaborated with some smart and innovative minds who inspired me profoundly. My collaborator Rong Ge has impressed me by his enthusiasm, intensity and incredible ability to disentangle complicated research problems. I would also like to acknowledge Chi Jin and Yang Yuan for always being available for discussions and brainstorming. I am especially grateful for working with Srini Turaga and Ernest Fraenkel. They provided comments and advice from fresh angles and stimulated me to think differently. I appreciate insightful and sparkling discussions with Sham Kakade, Daniel Hsu, David Mimno, David Blei, Qirong Ho, Alex Smola, Paul Mineiro, Nikos Karampatziakis and others. During my internship in Microsoft Research New England, I have met the most wonderful mentors Jennifer Chayes and Christian Borgs, whose support has powered me to chase my academic dreams.\nI would like to thank my committee members, Professor Athina Markopoulou, and Professor Carter Butts, who are always there for me whenever I need advice. In addition, a thank you to Professor Max Welling and Professor Alexander Ihler, who introduced me to machine learning, and stimulated my long lasting enthusiasm for machine learning. I also appreciate the efforts of Professor Padhraic Smyth, who started the Data Science Initiative, a growing interdisciplinary machine learning community, in UC Irvine.\nThe members of the MEGADatA group, Majid Janzamin, Hanie Sedghi, Niranjan UN, Forough Arabshahi, Yang Shi, Kamyar Azizzade, and Saeed Karimi Bidhendi, have brought immense amount of joy to my personal and professional time at UC Irvine. I am grateful for the nights we spent working on paper deadlines, as well as the fun times we had wearing bean sprout hair clips in the lab and posing for group profile pictures. The group has been a source of friendships and collaborations.\nI thank MIT Press for permission to include Chapter 2 of my thesis, which was originally published in Conference of Learning Theory. And I thank MIT Press for permission to include Chapter 3 and 4 of my thesis, which was originally published in Journal of Machine Learning. I gratefully acknowledge the funding sources that made my Ph.D. work possible. I was funded by the EECS Department fellowship. My work was also supported by the National Science Foundation BIGDATA award.\nxi\nLastly, I would like to thank my family for all their unconditional love and faithful support. Thank my parents, Jinsong Huang and Shaoyun Liu, for raising me with hard-working spirit and a love of science.

It is essential for success in modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. Latent variable models are versatile in unsupervised learning and have applications in almost every domain, e.g., social network analysis, natural language processing, computer vision and computational biology. Training latent variable models is challenging due to the non-convexity of the likelihood objective function. An alternative method is based on the spectral decomposition of low order moment matrices and tensors. This versatile framework is guaranteed to estimate the correct model consistently. My thesis spans both theoretical analysis of tensor decomposition framework and practical implementation of various applications.\nThis thesis presents theoretical results on convergence to globally optimal solution of tensor decomposition using the stochastic gradient descent, despite non-convexity of the objective. This is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees for the stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points.\nThis thesis also presents large-scale deployment of spectral methods (matrix and tensor decomposition) carried out on CPU, GPU and Spark platforms. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as random projection are incorporated for a highly parallel and scalable\nxvi\ntensor decomposition algorithm. We obtain a gain in both accuracies and in running times by several orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-art variational methods.\nTo solve real world problems, more advanced models and learning algorithms are proposed.

We are now able to do automated classification of images, where there are a predefined set of image categories. Due to the enormous amount of available labeled data, and powerful computation resources, we can train massive neural networks and obtain features for classification in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and text understanding. However, all these tasks fall under what we call supervised learning, where the training data provides label information. What if such labeled information about the categories is absent? Can we have automated discovery of the features and categories?\nThis problem is known as unsupervised learning, and experts agree that it is one of the hardest problems in machine learning. Unsupervised learning is usually the foundation for the success of supervised learning in many real world problems, and it aims at summarizing key features in the data. Human beings are known to be good at unsupervised learning, as we accumulate \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d or \u201ccommon sense.\u201d But can we have \u201cintelligent\u201d machines that mimic such capabilities?\n1\nWe live in a world with explosively growing data; as we receive more data, not only do we get more information but also are we confronted with more variables or \u201cunknowns\u201d. In other words, as the data grows, the number of variables also grows, and this is known as the high-dimensional regime. Learning the data patterns or the model in high dimensions is extremely challenging due to curse of dimensionality. However, the useful information that we need to gain an insightful understanding of the data usually hides in a low dimensional space. Finding these hidden structures is computationally challenging since it is akin to finding \u201ca needle in a haystack\u201d.\nThe hidden structures in data can be efficiently expressed with the use of probabilistic latent variable models. The computational task of searching for hidden structures is then expressed as learning a probabilistic latent variable model. Once the model is learned, the hidden variables can be inferred based on the model parameters, as depicted in Figure 1.1.\nThere exit numerous popular approaches for probabilistic latent variable model learning algorithms, among which two families of approaches are particularly successful: randomized algorithms (such as MCMC) and deterministic algorithms (such as maximum likelihood based variational inference). However, randomized algorithms are typically slow due to the exponential mixing time. The deterministic maximum likelihood based estimators tend to be faster than randomized algorithms, but the likelihood function is often intractable. One solution is to substitute the likelihood objective with its approximation and search for the optima. However, local search methods are susceptible to spurious local optima as the surrogate likelihoods are usually non-convex.\nIn this thesis, we analyze and deploy an alternative tensor decomposition framework for learning latent variable models. The basic paradigm of tensor decomposition framework dates back to 1894 when Pearson [135] proposed the method of moments, a classical parameter estimation technique using data statistics. The method of moments identifies the model whose parameters give rise to the observed aggregated statistics of the data (such\n2\nas empirical moments) [12]. Although matching the model parameters to the observed moments may involve solving computationally intractable systems of multivariate polynomial equations, low-order moments (typically third or fourth order) completely characterize the distribution for many classes of latent variable models [37, 36, 38, 128, 81, 15, 80], and decomposition of the low-order statistics of the data (tensors) reveals the consistent model parameters asymptotically. Therefore, the inverse method of moments is solved efficiently with consistency guarantees (both in terms of computational and sample complexity), in contrast to the computationally prohibitive maximum likelihood estimators which require non-convex optimization and are subject to local optimality."}, {"heading": "1.1 Summary of Contributions", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.1.1 Globally Guaranteed Online Tensor Decomposition", "text": "Learning latent variable models via method of moments involves a challenging non-convex optimization problem in the high-dimensional regime as tensor decomposition is NP-hard in general.

For instance, we implemented our tensor decomposition on spark to learn topics in the PubMed data, which consists of 8 million documents and 700 million words. Tensor method achieves much more accurate results (better likelihood) compared to variational inference although we never compute or optimize over the likelihood function. Furthermore, tensor method requires much less computation time and is at least an order of magnitude faster.\nAnother comparison is carried out on graph data to evaluate the performance of discovering hidden communities.

The success of these methods rely on a precise neuron level image alignment across different brains, which is computationally prohibitive.\nIn this thesis, we resolve the above problem using a spatial point process mixture model.

By fitting a point process mixture model jointly to the ISH images, we infer both the spatial point process distribution for each cell type and their gene expression profile.

We will use 4th order tensor as an example. If T \u2208 Rd4 is a 4th order tensor, we use Ti1,i2,i3,i4(i1, ..., i4 \u2208 [d]) to denote its (i1, i2, i3, i4) th entry.\nTensors can be constructed from tensor products. We use (u \u2297 v) to denote a 2nd order tensor where (u \u2297 v)i,j = uivj . This generalizes to higher order and we use u\u22974 to denote the 4th order tensor\n[u\u22974]i1,i2,i3,i4 = ui1ui2ui3ui4.\nWe say a 4th order tensor T \u2208 Rd4 has an orthogonal decomposition if it can be written as\nT =\nd\u2211\ni=1\na\u22974i , (1.1)\nwhere ai\u2019s are orthonormal vectors that satisfy \u2016ai\u2016 = 1 and aTi aj = 0 for i 6= j. We call the vectors ai\u2019s the components of this decomposition. Such a decomposition is unique up to permutation of ai\u2019s and sign-flips.\n9\nA tensor also defines a multilinear form (just as a matrix defines a bilinear form), for a pth order tensor T \u2208 Rdp and matrices Mi \u2208 Rd\u00d7ni , i \u2208 [p], we define\n[T (M1,M2, ...,Mp)]i1,i2,...,ip = \u2211\nj1,j2,...,jp\u2208[d] Tj1,j2,...,jp\n\u220f t\u2208[p] Mt[jt, it].\nThat is, the result of the multilinear form T (M1,M2, ...,Mp) is another tensor in R n1\u00d7n2\u00d7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00d7np. We will most often use vectors or identity matrices in the multilinear form. In particular, for a 4th order tensor T \u2208 Rd4 we know T (I, u, u, u) is a vector and T (I, I, u, u) is a matrix. In particular, if T has the orthogonal decomposition in (1.1), we know T (I, u, u, u) = \u2211d\ni=1(u Tai) 3ai\nand T (I, I, u, u) = \u2211d\ni=1(u Tai) 2aia T i .\nWhy are tensors powerful? Let us start with the simple matrix decomposition, where the goal is to discover the orthogonal eigenvectors of a matrix. However, it is known that if the eigenvalues of the matrix are equal to each other, one can not uniquely identify the eigenvectors. For instance, an identity matrix can be decomposed as the set of basis vector e1 and e2, as well as u1 and u2, who are 45 degree rotated e1 and e2:\n  1 0\n0 1\n  = e1e\u22a41 + e2e\u22a42 = u1u\u22a41 + u2u\u22a42 .\n10\nHowever, in tensors, there exists a unique decomposition even without eigenvalue gap. Let a third order tensor (a cube) be decomposed as a linear combination of 2 rank-1 tensors as in red and blue, see Figure 1.9a. The eigenvectors of the tensor are this red vector and this blue vector who are orthogonal to each other, and the eigenvalues of the tensor are equal. Consider taking a slice of the tensor, which yields matrix. This matrix shares the same eigenvectors with the tensor, but the eigenvalues of this matrix will be different depending on the direction of the slice. Therefore, the slice of tensor has eigenvalue gap. And thus we are able to identify the eigenvectors for the tensor uniquely. Since higher order tensors have additional dimensions and contains more information, it is more powerful than second-order matrices.\nOrthogonal tensor decomposition Given a tensor T with an orthogonal decomposition, the orthogonal tensor decomposition problem asks to find the individual components a1, ..., ad. This is a central problem in learning many latent variable models, including Hidden Markov Model, multi-view models, topic models, mixture of Gaussians and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). See the discussion and citations in [13]. Orthogonal tensor decomposition problem can be solved by many algorithms even when the input is a noisy estimation T\u0303 \u2248 T [77, 105, 13]. In practice this approach has been successfully applied to ICA [49], topic models [171] and community detection [87].\n11"}, {"heading": "1.3 Background and Related Works", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.3.1 Online Stochastic Gradient for Tensor Decomposition", "text": "Stochastic gradient descent is one of the basic algorithms in optimization. It is often used to solve the following stochastic optimization problem\nw = arg min w\u2208Rd f(w), where f(w) = Ex\u223cD[\u03c6(w, x)] (1.2)\nHere x is a data point that comes from some unknown distribution D, and \u03c6 is a loss function that is defined for a pair (x, w) of sample and parameters. We hope to minimize the expected loss E[\u03c6(w, x)].\nWhen the function f(w) is convex, convergence of stochastic gradient descent is well-understood [147, 138]. However, the stochastic gradient descent is not only limited to convex functions. Especially, in the context of neural networks, the stochastic gradient descent is known as the \u201cbackpropagation\u201d algorithm [141], and has been the main algorithm that underlies the success of deep learning [28]. However, the guarantees in the convex setting do not transfer to the non-convex settings.\nOptimizing a non-convex function is NP-hard in general. The difficulty comes from two aspects. First, the function may have many local minima, and it can be hard to find the best one (global minimum) among them. Second, even finding a local minimum can be hard as there can be many saddle points which have 0-gradient but are not local minima1. In the most general case, there is no known algorithm that guarantees to find a local minimum in a polynomial number of steps. The discrete analog (finding a local minimum in domains like {0, 1}n) has been studied in complexity theory and is PLS-complete [96]. 1See Section 2.2 for the definition of saddle points.\n12\nIn many cases, especially in those related to deep neural networks [53] [43], the main bottleneck in optimization is not due to local minima, but the existence of many saddle points. Gradient-based algorithms are in particular susceptible to saddle point problems as they only rely on the gradient information. The saddle point problem is alleviated for second-order methods that also rely on the Hessian information [53].\nHowever, using Hessian information usually increases the memory requirement and computation time per iteration. As a result, many applications still use stochastic gradient and empirically get reasonable results. In this paper we investigate why stochastic gradient methods can be effective even in presence of saddle point, in particular, we answer the following question:\nQuestion: Given a non-convex function f with many saddle points, what properties of f will guarantee stochastic gradient descent to converge to a local minimum efficiently?\nWe identify a property of non-convex functions which we call strict saddle. Intuitively, it guarantees local progress if we have access to the Hessian information. Surprisingly we show that, with only first order (gradient) information, the stochastic gradient escape from the saddle points efficiently. We provide a framework for analyzing stochastic gradient in both unconstrained and equality-constrained case using this property.\nWe apply our framework to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is a core problem in learning many latent variable models. The tensor decomposition problem is inherently susceptible to the saddle point issues, as the problem asks to find d different components and any permutation of the true components yields a valid solution. Such symmetry creates exponentially many local minima and saddle points in the optimization problem. Using our new analysis of stochastic gradient, we give the first online algorithm for orthogonal tensor decomposition with global convergence guarantee. This is a key step towards making tensor decomposition algorithms more scalable.\n13\nRelaxed notions of convexity In optimization theory and economics, there are extensive works on understanding functions that behave similarly to convex functions (and in particular can be optimized efficiently). Such notions involve pseudo-convexity [117], quasi-convexity [104], invexity[75] and their variants. More recently there are also works that consider classes that admit more efficient optimization procedures like RSC (restricted strong convexity) [3]. Although these classes involve functions that are non-convex, the function (or at least the function restricted to the region of analysis) still has a unique stationary point that is the desired local/global minimum. Therefore, these works cannot be used to prove global convergence for problems like tensor decomposition, where there are exponentially many local minima and saddle points by the symmetry of the problem.\nSecond-order algorithms The most popular second-order method is the Newton\u2019s method. Although Newton\u2019s method converges fast near a local minimum, its global convergence properties are less understood in the more general case. For non-convex functions, [63] gave a concrete example where second-order method converges to the desired local minimum in a polynomial number of steps (interestingly the function of interest is trying to find one component in a 4th order orthogonal tensor, which is a simpler case of our application). As Newton\u2019s method often converges also to saddle points, to avoid this behavior, different trusted-region algorithms are applied [53].\nStochastic gradient and symmetry The tensor decomposition problem we consider in this paper has the following symmetry: the solution is a set of d vectors v1, ..., vd. If (v1, v2, ..., vd) is a solution, then for any permutation \u03c0 and any sign flips \u03ba \u2208 {\u00b11}d, (.., \u03baiv\u03c0(i), ...) is also a valid solution. In general, symmetry is known to generate saddle points, and variants of gradient descent often perform reasonably in these cases (see [143], [139], [92]). The settings in these work are different from ours, and none of them give bounds on number of steps required for convergence.\n14\nMany other problems have the same symmetric structure as the tensor decomposition problem, including the sparse coding problem [132] and many deep learning applications [28]. In these problems, the goal is to learn multiple \u201cfeatures\u201d where the solution is invariant under permutation. Note that there are many recent papers on iterative/gradient-based algorithms for problems related to matrix factorization [93, 145]. These problems often have very different symmetry, as if Y = AX then for any invertible matrix R we know Y = (AR)(R\u22121X). In this case, all the equivalent solutions are in a connected low dimensional manifold, and there need not be saddle points between them."}, {"heading": "1.3.2 Applying Online Tensor Methods for Learning Latent Vari-", "text": "able Models\nThe spectral or moment-based approach involves decomposition of certain empirical moment tensors, estimated from observed data to obtain the parameters of the proposed probabilistic model. Unsupervised learning for a wide range of latent variable models can be carried out efficiently via tensor-based techniques with low sample and computational complexities [10]. In contrast, usual methods employed in practice such as expectation maximization (EM) and variational Bayes do not have such consistency guarantees. While the previous works [8] focused on theoretical guarantees, in chapter 3 of this thesis, we focus on the implementation of the tensor methods, study its performance on several datasets.\nWe introduce an online tensor decomposition based approach for two latent variable modeling problems namely, (1) community detection, in which we learn the latent communities that the social actors in social networks belong to, and (2) topic modeling, in which we infer hidden topics of text articles. We consider decomposition of moment tensors using stochastic gradient descent. We conduct optimization of multilinear operations in SGD and avoid directly forming the tensors, to save computational and storage costs. We present opti-\n15\nmized algorithm in two platforms. Our GPU-based implementation exploits the parallelism of SIMD architectures to allow for maximum speed-up by a careful optimization of storage and data transfer, whereas our CPU-based implementation uses efficient sparse matrix computations and is suitable for large sparse data sets. For the community detection problem, we demonstrate accuracy and computational efficiency on Facebook, Yelp, and DBLP data sets, and for the topic modeling problem, we also demonstrate good performance on the New York Times data set. We compare our results to the state-of-the-art algorithms such as the variational method and report a gain of accuracy and a gain of several orders of magnitude in the execution time.\nChapter 3 builds on the recent works of Anandkumar et al [10, 8] which establishes the correctness of tensor-based approaches for learning MMSB [5] models and other latent variable models. While, the earlier works provided a theoretical analysis of the method, the current paper considers a careful implementation of the method. Moreover, there are a number of algorithmic improvements in this thesis. For instance, while [10, 8] consider tensor power iterations, based on batch data and deflations performed serially, here, we adopt a stochastic gradient descent approach for tensor decomposition, which provides the flexibility to tradeoff sub-sampling with accuracy. Moreover, we use randomized methods for dimensionality reduction in the preprocessing stage of our method which enables us to scale our method to graphs with millions of nodes.\nThere are other known methods for learning the stochastic block model based on techniques such as spectral clustering [120] and convex optimization [39]. However, these methods are not applicable for learning overlapping communities. We note that learning the mixed membership model can be reduced to a matrix factorization problem [169]. While collaborative filtering techniques such as [126, 144] focus on matrix factorization and the prediction accuracy of recommendations on an unseen test set, we recover the underlying latent com-\n16\nmunities, which helps with the interpretability, and the statistical model can be employed for other tasks.\nAlthough there have been other fast implementations for community detection before [152, 112], these methods are not statistical and do not yield descriptive statistics such as bridging nodes [129], and cannot perform predictive tasks such as link classification which are the main strengths of the MMSB model. With the implementation of our tensor-based approach, we record huge speed-ups compared to existing approaches for learning the MMSB model.\nTo the best of our knowledge, while stochastic methods for matrix decomposition have been considered earlier [130, 18], this is the first work incorporating stochastic optimization for tensor decomposition, and paves the way for further investigation on many theoretical and practical issues. We also note that we never explicitly form or store the subgraph count tensor, of size O(n3) where n is the number of nodes, in our implementation, but directly manipulate the neighborhood vectors to obtain tensor decompositions through stochastic updates. This is a crucial departure from other works on tensor decompositions on GPUs [25, 146], where the tensor needs to be stored and manipulated directly."}, {"heading": "1.3.3 Dictionary Learning through Convolutional Tensor Decom-", "text": "position\nFeature or representation learning forms a cornerstone of modern machine learning. Representing the data in the relevant feature space is critical to obtaining good performance in challenging machine learning tasks in speech, computer vision and natural language processing. A popular representation learning framework is based on dictionary learning. Here, the input data is modeled as a linear combination of dictionary elements. However, this model fails to incorporate natural domain-specific invariances such as shift invariance and results in highly redundant dictionary elements, which makes inference in these models expensive.\n17\nThese shortcomings can be remedied by incorporating invariances into the dictionary model, and such models are known as convolutional models. Convolutional models are ubiquitous in machine learning for image, speech and sentence representations [167, 101, 33], and in neuroscience for modeling neural spike trains [131, 58]. Deep convolutional neural networks are a multi-layer extension of these models with non-linear activations. Such models have revolutionized performance in image, speech and natural language processing [167, 97]. The convolutional dictionary learning model posits that the input signal x is generated as a linear combination of convolutions of unknown dictionary elements or filters f \u22171 , . . . f \u2217 L and unknown activation maps w\u22171, . . . w \u2217 L:\nx = \u2211\ni\u2208[L] f \u2217i \u2217w\u2217i , (1.3)\nwhere [L] := 1, . . . , L.

(1.4)\nThe constraints (\u2016fi\u2016 = 1) are enforced, since otherwise, the scaling can be exchanged between the filters fi and the activation maps wi. Also, an additional regularization term (for example an \u21131 term on the w \u2032 is) is usually added to the above objective to promote sparsity on wi.\nA popular heuristic for solving (1.4) is based on alternating minimization [34], where the filters fi are optimized, while keeping the activations wi fixed, and vice versa. Each alternating update can be solved efficiently (since it is linear in each of the variables). However, the method is computationally expensive in the large sample setting since each iteration re-\n18\nquires a pass over all the samples, and in modern machine learning applications, the number of samples can run into billions. Moreover, alternating minimization has multiple spurious local optima, and reaching the global optimum of (1.4) is NP-hard in general. This problem is severely amplified in the convolutional setting due to additional symmetries, compared to the usual dictionary learning setting (without the convolutional operation). Due to shift invariance of the convolutional operator, shifting a filter fi by some amount, and applying a corresponding negative shift on the activation wi leaves the objective in (1.4) unchanged. Can we design alternative methods for convolutional dictionary learning that are scalable to huge datasets?\nThe special case of (1.3) with one filter (L = 1) is a well studied problem, and is referred to as blind deconvolution [90]. In general, this problem is not identifiable, i.e. multiple equivalent solutions can exist [44]. It has been documented that in many cases alternating minimization produces trivial solutions, where the filter f = x is the signal itself and the activation is the identity function [116]. Therefore, alternative techniques have been proposed, such as convex programs, based on nuclear norm minimization [4] and imposing hierarchical Bayesian priors for activation maps [163]. However, there is no analysis for settings with more than one filter. Incorporating Bayesian priors has shown to reduce the number of local optima, but not eliminate them [163, 109]. Moreover, Bayesian techniques are in general more expensive than alternating minimization.\nThe extension of blind deconvolution to multiple filters is known as convolutive blind source separation or convolutive independent component analysis (ICA) [90]. Previous methods directly reformulate convolutive ICA as an ICA model, without incorporating the shift constraints. Moreover, reformulation leads to an increase in the number of hidden sources from L to nL in the new model, where n is the input dimension, which is harder to separate and computationally more expensive. Other methods are based on performing ICA in the Fourier domain, but the downside is that the new mixing matrix depends on the angular fre-\n19\nquency, and leads to permutation and sign indeterminacies of the sources across frequencies. Complicated interpolation methods [90] overcome these indeterminacies. In contrast, our method avoids all these issues. We do not perform Fourier transform on the input. Instead, we employ FFTs at different iterations of our method to estimate the filters efficiently.\nThe dictionary learning problem without convolution has received much attention. Recent results show that simple iterative methods can learn the globally optimal solution [2, 19]. Also, tensor decomposition methods provably learn the model, when the activations are independently drawn (the ICA model) [12] or are sparse (the sparse coding model) [14]. In this work, we extend the tensor decomposition methods to efficiently incorporate the shift invariance constraints imposed by the convolution operator. This framework is applied to word-sequence embedding learning in natural language processing.\nWe have recently witnessed the tremendous success of word embeddings or word vector representations in natural language processing. This involves mapping words to vector representations such that words which share similar semantic or syntactic meanings are close to one another in the vector space [29, 47, 48, 124, 136]. Word embeddings have attained state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, chunking, named entity recognition (NER), and semantic role labeling. Despite this impressive performance, word embeddings do not suffice for more advanced tasks which require context-aware information or word orders, e.g. paraphrase detection, sentiment analysis, plagiarism detection, information retrieval and machine translation. Therefore, extracting word-sequence vector representations is crucial for expanding the realm of automated text understanding.\nPrevious works on word-sequence embeddings are based on a variety of mechanisms. A popular method is to learn the composition operators in sequences [125, 166]. The complexity of the compositionality varies widely: from simple operations such as addition [125, 166] to complicated recursive neural networks [149, 150, 27], convolutional neural networks [97, 97], long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks [154], or combinations of\n20\nthese architectures [161]. All these methods produce sentence representations that depend on a supervised task, and the class labels are back-propagated to update the composition weights [98].\nSince the above methods rely heavily on the downstream task and the domain of the training samples, they can hardly be used as universal embeddings across domains, and require intensive pre-training and hyper-parameter tuning. The state-of-the-art unsupervised framework is Skip-thought [103], based on an objective function that abstracts the skip-gram model to the sentence level, and encodes a sentence to predict the sentences around it. However, the skip-thought model requires a large corpus of contiguous text, such as the book corpus with more than 74 million sentences. Can we instead efficiently learn sentence embeddings using small amounts of samples without supervision/labels or annotated features(such as parse trees)? Also, can the sentence embeddings be context-aware, can handle variable lengths, and is not limited to specific domains?\nWe propose an unsupervised ConvDic+DeconvDec framework that satisfies all the above constraints. It is composed of two phases, a comprehension phase which summarizes template phrases using convolutional dictionary elements, followed by a feature-extraction phase which extracts activations using deconvolutional decoding. We propose a novel learning algorithm for the comprehension phase based on convolutional tensor decomposition. Note that in the comprehension phase, phrase templates are learned over fixed length small patches (patch length is equal to phrase template length), whereas entire word-sequence is decoded to get the final word-sequence embedding in the feature-extraction phase.\nWe employ our sentence embeddings in the tasks of sentiment classification, semantic textual similarity estimation, and paraphrase detection over eight datasets from various domains. These are challenging tasks since they require a contextual understanding of text relationships rather than bags of words. We learn the embeddings from scratch without using any auxiliary information. While previous works use information such as parse trees, Wordnet\n21\nor pre-train on a much larger corpus, we train from scratch on small amounts of text and obtain competitive results, which are close or even better than the state-of-the-art.\nThis is due to the combination of efficient modeling and learning approaches in our work. The convolutional model incorporates word orders and phrase representations, and our tensor decomposition algorithm can efficiently learn a set of parameters (phrase templates) for the convolutional model."}, {"heading": "1.3.4 Latent Tree Model Learning through Hierarchical Tensor", "text": "Decomposition\nLatent variable graphical models span flat models and hierarchical models, see Figure 1.10 for a flat multi-view model and a hierarchical model. Latent tree graphical models are a popular class of latent variable models, where a probability distribution involving observed and hidden variables are Markovian on a tree. Due to the fact that structure of (observable and hidden) variable interactions are approximated as a tree, inference on latent trees can be carried out exactly through a simple belief propagation [134]. Therefore, latent tree graphical models present a good trade-off between model accuracy and computational complexity. They are applicable in many domains, where it is natural to expect hierarchical or sequential relationships among the variables (through a hidden-Markov model). For instance, latent tree models have been employed for phylogenetic reconstruction [56], object recognition [40], [42] and human pose estimation [157].\nThe task of learning a latent tree model consists of two parts: learning the tree structure, and learning the parameters of the tree. There exist many challenges which prohibit efficient or guaranteed learning of the latent tree graphical model, which will be addressed in this thesis:\n22\n1. The location and the number of latent variables are hidden, and the marginalized graph\nover the observable variables no longer conforms to a tree structure.\n2. Structure learning algorithms are typically of computational complexity polynomial\nwith p (number of variables) as discussed in [6, 41]. These methods are serial in nature and therefore are not scalable for large p. 3. Parameter estimation in latent tree models is typically carried out through Expecta-\ntion Maximization (EM) or other local search heuristics [41]. These methods have no consistency guarantees, suffer from the problem of local optima and are not easily parallelizable. 4. Typically structure learning and parameter estimation are carried out one after an-\nother.\nThere has been widespread interest in developing distributed learning techniques, e.g., the recent works of [148] and [160]. These works consider parameter estimation via likelihoodbased optimizations such as Gibbs sampling, while our method involves more challenging tasks where both the structure and the parameters are estimated. Simple methods such as local neighborhood selection through \u21131-regularization [121] or local conditional independence testing [16] can be parallelized, but these methods do not incorporate hidden variables. Finally, note that the latent tree models provide a statistical description, in addition to\n23\nrevealing the hierarchy. In contrast, hierarchical clustering techniques are not based on a statistical model [108] and cannot provide valuable information such as the level of correlation between observed and hidden variables."}, {"heading": "1.4 Thesis Structure", "text": "In my thesis, I will first prove that simple noisy gradient descent on a carefully selected objective function yields global convergence guarantee in chapter 2.

I do not limit myself to shallow models where observations are conditional independent on the hidden dimension. On the contrary, I extend the multi-view tensor decomposition framework to a hierarchical tensor decomposition framework to analyze data with complicated hierarchical structure. A latent tree model is therefore proposed in chapter 5, where latent variable graphical model structure learning technique is combined with hierarchical tensor decomposition for a consistent learning of the hierarchical model structure and parameter.

Therefore, learning latent variable graphical model is reduced to tensor decomposition problem. Tensor decomposition is a non-convex optimization problem, and it is known that non-convex optimization problem is NP hard in general. Now the question is: could we use efficient methods such as stochastic gradient descent to reach local optima for a class of function under mild conditions? Could we fit tensor decomposition problem into the class of function?\nWe analyze stochastic gradient descent for optimizing non-convex functions. In many cases for non-convex functions the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that gradient updates are trapped in saddle points. In this chapter we identify strict saddle property for non-convex problem that allows for efficient optimization. Using this property we show that from an arbitrary starting point, stochastic gradient descent converges to a\n25\nlocal minimum in a polynomial number of iterations.

For these functions the Hessian of every saddle point has a negative eigenvalue. In particular, this means that local second-order algorithms which are similar to the ones in [53] can always make some progress.\nIt may seem counter-intuitive why stochastic gradient can work in these cases: in particular if we run the basic gradient descent starting from a stationary point then it will not move. However, we show that the saddle points are not stable and that the randomness in stochastic gradient helps the algorithm to escape from the saddle points.\nTheorem 2.1 (informal).

In this thesis we consider non-convex functions, which can still be \u03b2-smooth but cannot be strongly convex.\nSmoothness of Hessians It is common to assume the Hessian of the function f to be smooth.

Stationary points could be local minima, local maxima or saddle points. By local optimality conditions [164], in many cases we can tell what type a point w is by looking at its Hessian: if \u22072f(w) is positive definite then w is a local minimum; if \u22072f(w) is negative definite then w is a local maximum; if \u22072f(w) has both positive and negative eigenvalues then w is a saddle point. These criteria do not cover all the cases as there could be degenerate scenarios: \u22072f(w) can be positive semidefinite with an eigenvalue equal to 0, in which case the point could be a local minimum or a saddle point.\nIf a function does not have these degenerate cases, then we say the function is strict saddle:\nDefinition 2.2. A twice differentiable function f(w) is strict saddle, if all its local minima have \u22072f(w) \u227b 0 and all its other stationary points satisfy \u03bbmin(\u22072f(w)) < 0.\n29\nIntuitively, if we are not at a stationary point, then we can always follow the gradient and reduce the value of the function. If we are at a saddle point, we need to consider a second order Taylor expansion:\nf(w +\u2206w) \u2248 w + (\u2206w)T\u22072f(w)(\u2206w) +O(\u2016\u2206w\u20163).\nSince the strict saddle property guarantees \u22072f(w) to have a negative eigenvalue, there is always a point that is near w and has strictly smaller function value. It is possible to make local improvements as long as we have access to second order information. However it is not clear whether the more efficient stochastic gradient updates can work in this setting.\nTo make sure the local improvements are significant, we use a robust version of the strict saddle property:\nDefinition 2.3. A twice differentiable function f(w) is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle, if for any point w at least one of the following is true\n1. \u2016\u2207f(w)\u2016 \u2265 \u01eb.\n2. \u03bbmin(\u22072f(w)) \u2264 \u2212\u03b3.\n3.

Our proof technique can give explicit dependencies on these parameters however we hide these dependencies for simplicity of presentation. 1\nRemark (Decreasing learning rate). Often analysis of stochastic gradient descent uses decreasing learning rates and the algorithm converges to a local (or global) minimum. Since the function is strongly convex in the small region close to local minimum, we can use Theorem 2.3 to first find a point that is close to a local minimum, and then apply standard analysis\n1 Currently, our number of iteration is a large polynomial in the dimension d. We have not tried to optimize the degree of this polynomial. Empirically the dependency on d is much better, whether the dependency on d can be improved to poly log d is left as an open problem.\n31\nof SGD in the strongly convex case (where we decrease the learning rate by 1/t and get 1/ \u221a t convergence in \u2016w \u2212 w\u22c6\u2016).\nIn the next part we sketch the proof of the main theorem.

In this case we show the noise in our algorithm helps the algorithm to escape:\n32\nLemma 2.3 (Saddle point). Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.3, for any point wt where \u2016\u2207f(wt)\u2016 \u2264 C\u221a\u03b7 (for the same C as in Lemma 2.1), and \u03bbmin(\u22072f(wt)) \u2264 \u2212\u03b3, there is a number of steps T that depends on wt such that E[f(wt+T )] \u2264 f(wt)\u2212 \u2126\u0303(\u03b7). The number of steps T has a fixed upper bound Tmax that is independent of wt where T \u2264 Tmax = O\u0303(1/\u03b7).\nIntuitively, at point wt there is a good direction that is hiding in the Hessian. The hope of the algorithm is that the additional (or inherent) noise in the update step makes a small step towards the correct direction, and then the gradient information will reinforce this small perturbation and the future updates will \u201cslide\u201d down the correct direction.\nTo make this more formal, we consider a coupled sequence of updates w\u0303 such that the function to minimize is just the local second order approximation\nf\u0303(w) = f(wt) +\u2207f(wt)T (w \u2212 wt) + 1\n2 (w \u2212 wt)T\u22072f(wt)(w \u2212 wt).\nThe dynamics of stochastic gradient descent for this quadratic function is easy to analyze as w\u0303t+i can be calculated analytically. Indeed, we show the expectation of f\u0303(w\u0303) will decrease. More concretely we show the point w\u0303t+i will move substantially in the negative curvature directions and remain close to wt in positive curvature directions. We then use the smoothness of the function to show that as long as the points did not go very far from wt, the two update sequences w\u0303 and w will remain close to each other, and thus f\u0303(w\u0303t+i) \u2248 f(wt+i). Finally we prove the future wt+i\u2019s (in the next T steps) will remain close to wt with high probability by Martingale bounds. The detailed proof appears in Appendix A.1.\nWith these three lemmas it is easy to prove the main theorem. Intuitively, as long as there is a small probability of being O\u0303( \u221a \u03b7)-close to a local minimum, we can always apply Lemma 2.1 or Lemma 2.3 to make the expected function value decrease by \u2126\u0303(\u03b7) in at most O\u0303(1/\u03b7) iterations, this cannot go on for more than O\u0303(1/\u03b72) iterations because in that case\n33\nthe expected function value will decrease by more than 2B, but max f(x)\u2212min f(x) \u2264 2B by our assumption. Therefore in O\u0303(1/\u03b72) steps with at least constant probability wt will become O\u0303( \u221a \u03b7)-close to a local minimum. By Lemma 2.2 we know once it is close it will almost always stay close, so after q epochs of O\u0303(1/\u03b72) iterations each, the probability of success will be 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u2126(q)).

This symmetry property makes the natural optimization problems non-convex.\nIn this section we will give a new formulation of orthogonal tensor decomposition as an optimization problem, and show that this new problem satisfies the strict saddle property. Previously, [63] solves the problem of finding one component, with the following objective function\nmax \u2016u\u20162=1 T (u, u, u, u). (2.9)\n36\nIn Appendix A.3.1, as a warm-up example we show this function is indeed strict saddle, and we can apply Theorem 2.4 to prove global convergence of stochastic gradient descent algorithm.\nIt is possible to find all components of a tensor by iteratively finding one component, and do careful deflation, as described in [13] or [20]. However, in practice the most popular approaches like Alternating Least Squares [50] or FastICA [89] try to use a single optimization problem to find all the components. Empirically these algorithms are often more robust to noise and model misspecification.\nThe most straight-forward formulation of the problem aims to minimize the reconstruction error\nmin \u2200i,\u2016ui\u20162=1\n\u2016T \u2212 d\u2211\ni=1\nu\u22974i \u20162F . (2.10)\nHere \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016F is the Frobenius norm of the tensor which is equal to the \u21132 norm when we view the tensor as a d4 dimensional vector. However, it is not clear whether this function satisfies the strict saddle property, and empirically stochastic gradient descent is unstable for this objective.\nWe propose a new objective that aims to minimize the correlation between different components:\nmin \u2200i,\u2016ui\u20162=1\n\u2211\ni 6=j T (ui, ui, uj, uj), (2.11)\nTo understand this objective intuitively, we first expand vectors uk in the orthogonal basis formed by {ai}\u2019s. That is, we can write uk = \u2211d i=1 zk(i)ai, where zk(i) are scalars that correspond to the coordinates in the {ai} basis. In this way we can rewrite T (uk, uk, ul, ul) =\n37\n\u2211d i=1(zk(i)) 2(zl(i)) 2. From this form it is clear that the T (uk, uk, ul, ul) is always nonnegative, and is equal to 0 only when the support of zk and zl do not intersect. For the objective function, we know in order for it to be equal to 0 the z\u2019s must have disjoint support. Therefore, we claim that {uk}, \u2200k \u2208 [d] is equivalent to {ai}, \u2200i \u2208 [d] up to permutation and sign flips when the global minimum (which is 0) is achieved.\nWe further show that this optimization program satisfies the strict saddle property and all its local minima in fact achieves global minimum value. The proof is deferred to Appendix A.3.2.\nTheorem 2.5. The optimization problem (2.11) is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle, for \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4 = 1/poly(d). Moreover, all its local minima have the form ui = \u03baia\u03c0(i) for some \u03bai = \u00b11 and permutation \u03c0(i).\nNote that we can also generalize this to handle 4th order tensors with different positive weights on the components, or other order tensors, see Appendix A.3.3."}, {"heading": "2.3.2 Implementing Stochastic Gradient Oracle", "text": "To design an online algorithm based on objective function (2.11), we need to give an implementation for the stochastic gradient oracle.\nIn applications, the tensor T is oftentimes the expectation of multilinear operations of samples g(x) over x where x is generated from some distribution D. In other words, for any x \u223c D, the tensor is T = E[g(x)]. Using the linearity of the multilinear map, we know E[g(x)](ui, ui, uj, uj) = E[g(x)(ui, ui, uj, uj)]. Therefore we can define the loss function \u03c6(u, x) = \u2211\ni 6=j g(x)(ui, ui, uj, uj), and the stochastic gradient oracle SG(u) = \u2207u\u03c6(u, x).\n38\nFor concreteness, we look at a simple ICA example. In the simple setting we consider an unknown signal x that is uniform2 in {\u00b11}d, and an unknown orthonormal linear transformation3 A (AAT = I). The sample we observe is y := Ax \u2208 Rd. Using standard techniques (see [35]), we know the 4-th order cumulant of the observed sample is a tensor that has orthogonal decomposition.

The tensor T can be written as a function of the auxiliary tensor Z and multilinear form of the sample y. Lemma 2.4. The expectation E[1 2 (Z \u2212 y\u22974)] = \u2211di=1 a\u22974i = T , where ai\u2019s are columns of the unknown orthonormal matrix A.\nThis lemma is easy to verify, and is closely related to cumulants [35]. Recall that \u03c6(u, y) denotes the loss (objective) function evaluated at sample y for point u. Let \u03c6(u, y) = \u2211 i 6=j 1 2 (Z \u2212 y\u22974)(ui, ui, uj, uj). By Lemma 2.4, we know that E[\u03c6(u, y)] is equal to the objective function as in Equation (2.11). Therefore we rewrite objective (2.11) as the following stochastic optimization problem\nmin \u2200i,\u2016ui\u20162=1\nE[\u03c6(u, y)], where \u03c6(u, y) = \u2211\ni 6=j\n1 2 (Z \u2212 y\u22974)(ui, ui, uj, uj)\n2In general ICA the entries of x are independent, non-Gaussian variables. 3In general (under-complete) ICA this could be an arbitrary linear transformation, however usually after\nthe \u201cwhitening\u201d step (see [35]) the linear transformation becomes orthonormal.\n39\nThe stochastic gradient oracle is then\n\u2207ui\u03c6(u, y) = \u2211\nj 6=i\n( \u3008uj, uj\u3009ui + 2 \u3008ui, uj\u3009uj \u2212 \u3008uj, y\u30092 \u3008ui, y\u3009 y ) . (2.12)\nNotice that computing this stochastic gradient does not require constructing the 4-th order tensor T \u2212 y\u22974. In particular, this stochastic gradient can be computed very efficiently:\nRemark. The stochastic gradient (2.12) can be computed for all ui\u2019s in O(d 3) time for one sample or O(d3 + d2k) for average of k samples.\nProof. The proof is straight forward as the first two terms on the right hand side take O(d3) and is shared by all samples. The third term can be efficiently computed once the innerproducts between all the y\u2019s and all the ui\u2019s are computed (which takes O(kd 2) time)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Experiments", "text": "We run simulations for Projected Noisy Gradient Descent (Algorithm 2) applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition. The results show that the algorithm converges from random initial points efficiently (as predicted by the theorems), and our new formulation (2.11) performs better than reconstruction error (2.10) based formulation.\nSettings We set dimension d = 10, the input tensor T is a random tensor in R10 4 that has orthogonal decomposition (1.1). The step size is chosen carefully for respective objective functions.

This is a very simple way of generating samples, and we use it as a sanity check for the objective functions.\nIn the second case we consider the ICA example introduced in Section 2.3.2, and use Equation (2.12) to compute a stochastic gradient. In this case the stochastic gradient has a large variance, so we use mini-batch of size 100 to reduce the variance.\nComparison of objective functions We use the simple way of generating samples for our new objective function (2.11) and reconstruction error objective (2.10). The result is shown in Figure 2.1. Our new objective function is empirically more stable (always converges within 10000 iterations); the reconstruction error do not always converge within the same number of iterations and often exhibits long periods with small improvement (which is likely to be caused by saddle points that do not have a significant negative eigenvalue).\nSimple ICA example As shown in Figure 2.2, our new algorithm also works in the ICA setting. When the learning rate is constant the error stays at a fixed small value. When we decrease the learning rate the error converges to 0.\n41"}, {"heading": "2.5 Conclusion", "text": "In this chapter we identify the strict saddle property and show stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum under this assumption.

Theoretically, it is solid and well justified. We will now fill in the gap of theoretical findings and practical applications by applying the algorithm to real world problems.\nWe consider two problems: (1) community detection (wherein we compute the decomposition of a tensor which relates to the count of 3-stars in a graph) and (2) topic modeling (wherein we consider the tensor related to co-occurrence of triplets of words in documents); decomposition of the these tensors allows us to learn the hidden communities and topics from observed data.\nCommunity detection: We recover hidden communities in several real datasets with high accuracy. When ground-truth communities are available, we propose a new error score based on the hypothesis testing methodology involving p-values and false discovery rates [153] to validate our results. The use of p-values eliminates the need to carefully tune the number of communities output by our algorithm, and hence, we obtain a flexible trade-off between the\n43\nfraction of communities recovered and their estimation accuracy. We find that our method has very good accuracy on a range of network datasets: Facebook, Yelp and DBLP. We summarize the datasets used in this chapter in Table 3.5. To get an idea of our running times, let us consider the larger DBLP collaborative data set for a moment. It consists of 16 million edges, one million nodes and 250 communities. We obtain an error of 10% and the method runs in about two minutes, excluding the 80 minutes taken to read the edge data from files stored on the hard disk and converting it to sparse matrix format.\nCompared to the state-of-the-art method for learning MMSB models using the stochastic variational inference algorithm of [70], we obtain several orders of magnitude speed-up in the running time on multiple real datasets. This is because our method consists of efficient matrix operations which are embarrassingly parallel. Matrix operations are carried out in the sparse format which is efficient especially for social network settings involving large sparse graphs. Moreover, our code is flexible to run on a range of graphs such as directed, undirected and bipartite graphs, while the code of [70] is designed for homophilic networks, and cannot handle bipartite graphs in its present format. Note that bipartite networks occur in the recommendation setting such as the Yelp data set. Additionally, the variational implementation in [70] assumes a homogeneous connectivity model, where any pair of communities connect with the same probability and the probability of intra-community connectivity is also fixed. Our framework does not suffer from this restriction. We also provide arguments to show that the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and other scores, previously used for evaluating the recovery of overlapping community, can underestimate the errors.\nTopic modeling: We also employ the tensor method for topic-modeling, and there are many similarities between the topic and community settings. For instance, each document has multiple topics, while in the network setting, each node has membership in multiple communities. The words in a document are generated based on the latent topics in the document, and similarly, edges are generated based on the community memberships of the node pairs.\n44\nThe tensor method is even faster for topic modeling, since the word vocabulary size is typically much smaller than the size of real-world networks. We learn interesting hidden topics in New York Times corpus from UCI bag-of-words data set1 with around 100, 000 words and 300, 000 documents in about two minutes. We present the important words for recovered topics, as well as interpret \u201cbridging\u201d words, which occur in many topics.\nImplementations: We present two implementations, viz., a GPU-based implementation which exploits the parallelism of SIMD architectures and a CPU-based implementation for larger datasets, where the GPU memory does not suffice. We discuss various aspects involved such as implicit manipulation of tensors since explicitly forming tensors would be unwieldy for large networks, optimizing for communication bottlenecks in a parallel deployment, the need for sparse matrix and vector operations since real world networks tend to be sparse, and a careful statistical approach to validating the results, when ground truth is available."}, {"heading": "3.1 Tensor Forms for Topic and Community Models", "text": "In this section, we briefly recap the topic and community models, as well as the tensor forms for their exact moments, derived in [10, 8]."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Topic Modeling", "text": "In topic modeling, a document is viewed as a bag of words.

Thus, we can employ a unified framework for both topic and community modeling involving decomposition of the third order moment tensors MTop3 and M Com 3 . Second order moments M Top 2 and M Com 2 are used for preprocessing of the data (i.e., whitening, which is introduced in detail in Section 3.2.1).

We give the overview of these methods below. Again, we use graph community membership model without loss of generality.\nRandomized low rank approximation: From [66], for the k-rank positive semi-definite matrix M2 \u2208 RnA\u00d7nA with nA \u226b k, we can perform random projection to reduce dimensionality. More precisely, if we have a random matrix S \u2208 RnA\u00d7k\u0303 with unit norm (rotation matrix), we project M2 onto this random matrix to get R n\u00d7k\u0303 tall-thin matrix.

However for sparse M2, S \u2208 {0, 1}n\u00d7k\u0303 is a column selection matrix with random sign for each entry.\nAfter the projection, one approach we use is SVD on this tall-thin (Rn\u00d7k\u0303) matrix.

Recall that the definition of a whitening matrix W is that W\u22a4M2W = I. We can obtain the whitening matrix of M2 without directly doing a SVD on M2 \u2208 RnA\u00d7nA.\nTall-thin SVD: This is used in the CPU implementation.

Although the GPU has SIMD architecture which makes parallelization efficient, it lacks advanced libraries with sparse SVD operations and out-of-GPU-core implementations. We therefore implement the sparse format on CPU for sparse datasets. We implement our algorithm using random projection for efficient dimensionality reduction [45] along with the sparse matrix operations available in the Eigen toolkit2, and we use the SVDLIBC [30] library to compute sparse SVD via the Lanczos algorithm. Theoretically, the Lanczos algorithm [69] on a n\u00d7n matrix takes around (2d+8)n flops for a single step where d is the average number of non-zero entries per row.\n2http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page\n57\nTall-thin QR: This is used in the GPU implementation due to the lack of library to do sparse tall-thin SVD. The difference is that we instead implement a tall-thin QR on O, therefore the whitening matrix is obtained as\nW \u2248 Q(R\u2020)\u22a4(\u2126 12 )\u22a4.\nThe main bottleneck for our GPU implementation is device storage, since GPU memory is highly limited and not expandable. Random projections help in reducing the dimensionality from O(n\u00d7 n) to O(n\u00d7 k) and hence, this fits the data in the GPU memory better. Consequently, after the whitening step, we project the data into k-dimensional space. Therefore, the STGD step is dependent only on k, and hence can be fit in the GPU memory. So, the main bottleneck is computation of large SVDs. In order to support larger datasets such as the DBLP data set which exceed the GPU memory capacity, we extend our implementation with out-of-GPU-core matrix operations and the Nystrom method [66] for the whitening matrix computation and the pseudoinverse computation in the pre-processing module.\n58"}, {"heading": "3.3.3 Stochastic Updates", "text": "STGD can potentially be the most computationally intensive task if carried out naively since the storage and manipulation of a O(n3)-sized tensor makes the method not scalable.

We obtain whitened vectors yA, yB and yC and manipulate these vectors efficiently to obtain tensor eigenvector updates using the gradient scaled by a suitable learning rate.\nEfficient STGD via stacked vector operations: We convert the BLAS II into BLAS III operations by stacking the vectors to form matrices, leading to more efficient operations. Although the updating equation for the stochastic gradient update is presented serially, we can update the k eigenvectors simultaneously in parallel. The basic idea is to stack the k eigenvectors \u03c6i \u2208 Rk into a matrix \u03a6, then using the internal parallelism designed for BLAS III operations.\nOverall, the STGD step involves 1 + k + i(2 + 3k) BLAS II over Rk vectors, 7N BLAS III over Rk\u00d7k matrices and 2 QR operations over Rk\u00d7k matrices, where i denotes the number of iterations.

This makes it suitable for storing the required buffers in the GPU memory, and using the CULA device interface for the BLAS operations. In Figure 3.2, we illustrate the data transfer involved in the GPU standard and device interface codes. While the standard interface involves data transfer (including whitened neighborhood vectors and the eigenvectors) at each stochastic iteration between the CPU memory and the GPU memory, the device interface involves allocating and retaining the eigenvectors at each stochastic iteration which in turn speeds up the spectral estimation.\n60\nWe compare the running time of the CULA device code with the MATLAB code (using the tensor toolbox [23]), CULA standard code and Eigen sparse code in Figure 3.3. As expected, the GPU implementations of matrix operations are much faster and scale much better than the CPU implementations. Among the CPU codes, we notice that sparsity and optimization offered by the Eigen toolkit gives us huge gains. We obtain orders of magnitude of speed up for the GPU device code as we place the buffers in the GPU memory and transfer minimal amount of data involving the whitened vectors only once at the beginning of each iteration. The running time for the CULA standard code is more than the device code because of the CPU-GPU data transfer overhead. For the same reason, the sparse CPU implementation, by avoiding the data transfer overhead, performs better than the GPU standard code for very small number of communities.

This is justified considering that we implement our method on GPUs and matrix products are embarrassingly parallel. Note that this is different from serial computational complexity. We now break down the entries in Table 3.2. First, we recall a basic lemma regarding the lower bound on the time complexity for parallel addition along with the required number of cores to achieve a speed-up.\nLemma 3.4. [94] Addition of s numbers in serial takes O(s) time; with \u2126(s/ log s) cores, this can be improved to O(log s) time in the best case.\nEssentially, this speed-up is achieved by recursively adding pairs of numbers in parallel.\nLemma 3.5.

We multiply an O(n)\u00d7 O(n) matrix M2 with an O(n)\u00d7 O(k) random matrix S. Therefore, this requires O(nsk) serial operations, where s is the number of non-zero elements per row/column of M2. Using Lemma 3.5, given c = nsk log s cores, we could\n62\nachieve O(log s) computational complexity. However, the parallel computational complexity is not further reduced with more than nsk log s cores.\nAfter the multiplication, we use tall-thin SVD for CPU implementation, and tall-thin QR for GPU implementation.\nTall-thin SVD: We perform Lanczos SVD on the tall-thin sparse O(n)\u00d7O(k) matrix, which involves a tri-diagonalization followed with the QR on the tri-diagonal matrix. Given c = nsk log s cores, the computational complexity of the tri-diagonalization is O(log s). We then do QR on the tridiagonal matrix which is as cheap as O(k2) serially. Each orthogonalization requires O(k) inner products of constant entry vectors, and there are O(k) such orthogonalizations to be done. Therefore given O(k) cores, the complexity is O(k). More cores does not help since the degree of parallelism is k.\nTall-thin QR: Alternatively, we perform QR in the GPU implementation which takes O(sk2). To arrive at the complexity of obtaining Q, we analyze the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure under sparsity and parallelism conditions. Consider a serial Gram-Schmidt on k columns (which are s-dense) of O(n) \u00d7 O(k) matrix. For each of the columns 2 to k, we perform projection on the previously computed components and subtract it. Both inner product and subtraction operations are on the s-dense columns and there are O(s) operations which are done O(k2) times serially. The last step is the normalization of k s-dense vectors with is an O(sk) operation. This leads to a serial complexity of O(sk2+sk) = O(sk2). Using this, we may obtain the parallel complexity in different regimes of the number of cores as follows.\nParallelism for inner products : For each component i, we need i \u2212 1 projections on previous components which can be parallel. Each projection involves scaling and inner product operations on a pair of s-dense vectors. Using Lemma 3.4, projection for component i can\n63\nbe performed in O(max( sk c , log s)) time. O(log s) complexity is obtained using O(sk/ log s) cores.\nParallelism for subtractions : For each component i, we need i \u2212 1 subtractions on a sdense vector after the projection. Serially the subtraction requires O(sk) operations, and this can be reduced to O(log k) with O(sk/ log k) cores in the best case. The complexity is O(max( sk c , log k)). Combing the inner products and subtractions, the complexity is O ( max( sk\nc , log s)\n+max( sk c , log k)\n) for component i. There are k components in total, which can not be\nparallel. In total, the complexity for the parallel QR is O ( max( sk 2\nc , log s) + max( sk\n2\nc , log k)\n) .\nShort-thin SVD: SVD of the smaller O(Rk\u00d7k) matrix time requires O(k3) computations in serially. We note that this is the bottleneck for the computational complexity, but we emphasize that k is sufficiently small in many applications. Furthermore, this k3 complexity can be reduced by using distributed SVD algorithms e.g. [99, 62]. An analysis with respect to Lanczos parallel SVD is similar with the discussion in the Tall-thin SVD paragraph. The complexity is O(max(k3/c, log k)+max(k2/c, k)).

In the regime that n \u226b k, our algorithm is more efficient.

The average error function is defined as\nE := 1 k\n\u2211\n(i,j)\u2208E{P val }\n   1 n \u2211\nx\u2208|X|\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03a0\u0302i(x)\u2212\u03a0j(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223    ,\nwhere E{Pval} denotes the set of edges based on thresholding of the p-values.\nThe error function incorporates two aspects, namely the l1 norm error between each estimated community and the corresponding paired ground truth community, and the error induced by false pairings between the estimated and ground-truth communities through p-value testing. For the former l1 norm error, we normalize with n which is reasonable and results in the range of the error in [0, 1]. For the latter, we define the average error function as the summation of all paired memberships errors divided by the true number of communities k. In this way we penalize falsely discovered pairings by summing them up. Our error function can be greater than 1 if there are too many falsely discovered pairings through p-value testing (which can be as large as k \u00d7 k\u0302).\nBridgeness: Bridgeness in overlapping communities is an interesting measure to evaluate. A bridge is defined as a vertex that crosses structural holes between discrete groups of people and bridgeness analyzes the extent to which a given vertex is shared among different\n69\ncommunities [129].

Overall, our learning algorithm performs better in the stochastic block model case than in the mixed membership model case although we note that the accuracy is quite high for practical purposes. Theoretically, this is expected since smaller concentration parameter \u03b10 is easier for our algorithm to learn [8]. Also, our algorithm is scalable to an order of magnitude larger in n as illustrated by experiments on real-world large-scale datasets.\n70\nNote that we threshold the estimated memberships to clean the results. There is a tradeoff between match ratio and average error via different thresholds. In synthetic experiments, the tradeoff is not evident since a perfect matching is always present. However, we need to carefully handle this in experiments involving real data.\nResults on Topic Modeling: We perform experiments for the bag of words data set [22] for The New York Times. We set the concentration parameter to be \u03b10 = 1 and observe top recovered words in numerous topics. The results are in Table 3.3. Many of the results are expected. For example, the top words in topic # 11 are all related to some bad personality.\nWe also present the words with most spread membership, i.e., words that belong to many topics as in Table 3.4. As expected, we see minutes, consumer, human, member and so on. These words can appear in a lot of topics, and we expect them to connect topics.\nResults on Real-world Graph Datasets: We describe the results on real datasets summarized in Table 3.5 in detail below. The simulations are summarized in Table 3.6.\nThe results are presented in Table 3.6. We note that our method, in both dense and sparse implementations, performs very well compared to the state-of-the-art variational method. For the Yelp dataset, we have a bipartite graph where the business nodes are on one side and user nodes on the other and use the review stars as the edge weights. In this bipartite setting, the variational code provided by Gopalan et al [70] does not work on since it is not applicable to non-homophilic models. Our approach does not have this restriction. Note that we use our dense implementation on the GPU to run experiments with large number of communities k as the device implementation is much faster in terms of running time of the STGD step.On the other hand, the sparse implementation on CPU is fast and memory efficient in the case of sparse graphs with a small number of communities while the dense implementation on GPU is faster for denser graphs such as Facebook.

Effectively, our algorithm, excluding the file I/O time, executes within two minutes for k = 10 and within ten minutes for k = 100.\nInterpretation on Yelp Dataset: The ground truth on business attributes such as location and type of business are available (but not provided to our algorithm) and we provide the distribution in Figure 3.5 on the left side. There is also a natural trade-off between recovery ratio and average error or between attempting to recover all the business communities and the accuracy of recovery. We can either recover top significant communities with high accuracy or recover more with lower accuracy. We demonstrate the trade-off in Figure 3.5 on the right side.\n73\nWe select the top ten categories recovered with the lowest error and report the business with highest weights in \u03a0\u0302. Among the matched communities, we find the business with the highest membership weight (Table 3.7). We can see that most of the \u201ctop\u201d recovered businesses are rated high. Many of the categories in the top ten list are restaurants as they have a large number of reviewers. Our method can recover restaurant category with high accuracy, and the specific restaurant in the category is a popular result (with high number of stars). Also, our method can also recover many of the categories with low review counts accurately like hobby shops, yoga, churches, galleries and religious organizations which are the \u201cniche\u201d categories with a dedicated set of reviewers, who mostly do not review other categories.\nOur algorithm can also recover the attributes of users. However, the ground truth available about users is far more limited than businesses, and we only have information on gender, average review counts and average stars (we infer the gender of the users through their\n74\nnames). Our algorithm can recover all these attributes. We observe that gender is the hardest to recover while review counts is the easiest. We see that the other user attributes recovered by our algorithm correspond to valuable user information such as their interests, location, age, lifestyle, etc. This is useful, for instance, for businesses studying the characteristics of their users, for delivering better personalized advertisements for users, and so on.\nFacebook Dataset: A snapshot of the Facebook network of UNC [155] is provided with user attributes. The ground truth communities are based on user attributes given in the dataset which are not exposed to the algorithm. There are 360 top communities with sufficient (at least 20) users. Our algorithm can recover these attributes with high accuracy compared with variational inference result [70].\nWe also obtain results for a range of values of \u03b10 (Figure 3.6). We observe that the recovery ratio improves with larger \u03b10 since a larger \u03b10 can recover overlapping communities more efficiently while the error score remains relatively the same.\nFor the Facebook dataset, the top ten communities recovered with lowest error consist of certain high schools, second majors and dorms/houses. We observe that high school attributes are easiest to recover and second major and dorm/house are reasonably easy to recover by looking at the friendship relations in Facebook. This is reasonable: college students from\n75\nthe same high school have a high probability of being friends; so do colleges students from the same dorm."}, {"heading": "DBLP Dataset:", "text": "The DBLP data contains bibliographic records5 with various publication venues, such as journals and conferences, which we model as communities.

There are several key insights involved. Firstly, our approach follows from a systematic and guaranteed learning procedure in contrast to several heuristic approaches which may not have strong statistical recovery guarantees.\n5http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/Dblp.xml\n76\nSecondly, though using a moment-based formulation may seem computationally expensive at first sight, implementing implicit \u201ctensor\u201d operations leads to significant speed-ups of the algorithm. Thirdly, employing randomized methods for spectral methods is promising in the computational domain, since the running time can then be significantly reduced.\nThis work paves the way for several interesting directions for further research. While our current deployment incorporates community detection in a single graph, extensions to multigraphs and hypergraphs are possible in principle. A careful and efficient implementation for such settings will be useful in a number of applications. It is natural to extend the deployment to even larger datasets by having cloud-based systems. The issue of efficient partitioning of data and reducing communication between the machines becomes significant there. Combining our approach with other simple community detection approaches to gain even more speedups can be explored.\n77\nChapter 4"}, {"heading": "Dictionary Learning through", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Convolutional Tensor Decomposition", "text": "In this chapter, we extend tensor decomposition framework to models with invariances, such as convolutional dictionary models. Learning invariant dictionary elements is crucial to remove unnecessary model redundancy in a lot of settings. For instance, in image filter bank learning where image filters\u2019 activation locations in the image are ignored, in natural language process where the phrase templates are not distinguished by their location in the sentence, and in neural science where neural spikes consist of template spikes activated at different time.\nWe propose a tensor decomposition algorithm to solve this problem of learning shift invariant dictionary elements. Our tensor decomposition algorithm is based on the popular alternating least squares (ALS) method, but with additional shift invariance constraints on the factors. We demonstrate that each ALS update can be computed efficiently using simple operations such as fast Fourier transforms and matrix multiplications. Our algorithm converges to mod-\n78\nels with better reconstruction error and is much faster, compared to the popular alternating minimization heuristic, where the filters and activation maps are alternately updated.\nWe propose a novel framework for learning convolutional models through tensor decomposition. We consider inverse method of moments to estimate the model parameters via decomposition of higher order (third or fourth order) moment tensors. When the inputs x are generated from a convolutional model in (1.3), with independent activation maps w\u2217i , i.e. a convolutional ICA model, we show that the cumulant tensors have a CP decomposition, whose components correspond to filters and their circulant shifts. We propose a novel method for tensor decomposition when such circulant constraints are imposed on the components of the tensor decomposition.\nOur tensor decomposition method is a constrained form of the popular alternating least squares (ALS) method1. We show that the resulting optimization problem in each tensor ALS iteration can be solved in closed form, and uses simple operations such as Fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and matrix multiplications. These operations have a high degree of parallelism: for estimating L filters, each of length n, we require O(logn + logL) time and O(L2n3) processors. Note that there is no dependence on the number of data samples N , since the empirical moment tensor can be computed in one data pass, and the ALS iterations only updates the filters. This is a huge saving in running time, compared to the alternate minimization method which requires a pass over data in each step to decode all the activation maps wi. The running time of alternating minimization is O(max(logn logL, log n logN)) per iteration with O(max( nNL logN , nNL logL )) processors, and when N \u226b Ln2, which is the typical scenario, our method is hugely advantageous. Our method avoids decoding the activation maps in each iteration since they are averaged out in the input moment tensor, on which the ALS method operates and we only estimate the filters fi in the learning step. In other\n1The ALS method for tensor decomposition is not to be confused with the alternating minimization method for solving (1.4). While (1.4) acts on data samples and alternates between updating filters and activation maps, tensor ALS operates on averaged moment tensors and alternates between different modes of the tensor decomposition.\n79\nwords, the activation maps wi\u2019s are easily estimated using (1.4) in one data pass after filter estimation. Thus, our method is highly parallel and scalable to huge datasets.\nWe carefully optimize computation and memory costs by exploiting tensor algebra and circulant structure, due to the shift invariance of the convolutional model. We implicitly carry out many of the operations and do not form large (circulant) matrices and minimize storage requirements. Preliminary experiments further demonstrate superiority of our method compared to alternating minimization. Our algorithm converges accurately and much faster to the true underlying filters compared to alternating minimization. Moreover, it results in much lower reconstruction error, while alternating minimization tends to get stuck in spurious local optima.

This holds for zero-mean activations and we need to use fourth order cumulant instead. Our method extends in a straightforward manner for higher order cumulants.\nThe decomposition form in (4.5) is known as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition form [12] (the usual form has the decomposition of the tensor and not its unfolding, as above).

A bulk of the computational effort will go into computing M in (4.8). Computation of M requires 2L fast Fourier Transforms of length n filters and simple matrix multiplications without explicitly forming G or H. We make this concrete in the next section.

However, forming and computing with these matrices is very expensive when n (and L) are large. Instead, we utilize the properties of circulant matrices and the Khatri-Rao product \u2299 to efficiently carry out these computations implicitly. We present our final result on computational complexity of the proposed method. Recall that n is the filter size and L is the number of filters.\nLemma 4.2. [Computational Complexity] With multi-threading, the running time of our algorithm for n dimensional input and L number of filters is O(logn+logL) per iteration using O(L2n3) processors.\nNote that before the iterative updates, we compute the third order cumulant2 C3 once whose computational complexity is O(logN) with N logN processors, where N is the number of samples. However, this operation is not iterative. In contrast, alternating minimization (AM) requires pass over all the data samples in each iteration, while our algorithm requires only one pass of the data.\nThe parallel computational complexity of AM is as follows. In each iteration of AM, computing the derivative with respect to either filters or activation maps requires NL number of FFTs (requires O(NLn log n) serial time), and the degrees of parallelism are O(Nn logL) and O(Nn logn) respectively. Therefore with multi-threading, the running time of AM is O(max(logn logL, logn logN)) per iteration using O(max( nNL logN , nNL logL )) processors.

We use the notation blkij(\u03a8) for a matrix \u03a8 \u2208 RnL\u00d7nL to denote (i, j)th block of size n\u00d7 n.\nLemma 4.3 (Form of (H\u22a4H). \u22c6 (G\u22a4G) ).

Our method is an unsupervised approach as in skip-thought vectors. However, our algorithm doesn\u2019t output universal word-sequence embeddings across domains. We train a fresh model and a new set of domain phrase templates from scratch. Therefore our algorithm is performing better for these individual datasets on the STS task.\n101"}, {"heading": "4.7 Conclusion", "text": "In this chapter, we proposed a novel tensor decomposition framework for learning convolutional dictionary models. Unlike the popular alternating minimization, our method avoids expensive decoding of activation maps in each step and can reach better solutions with faster run times. We derived efficient updates for tensor decomposition based on modified alternating least squares, and it consists of simple operations such as FFTs and matrix multiplications. Our framework easily extends to convolutional models for higher dimensional signals (such as images), where the circulant matrix is replaced with block circulant matrices [73]. More generally, our framework can handle general group structure, by replacing the FFT operation with the appropriate group FFT [106]. By combining the advantages of tensor methods with a general class of invariant representations, we thus have a powerful paradigm for learning efficient latent variable models and embeddings in a variety of domains.\n102\nChapter 5"}, {"heading": "Latent Tree Model Learning through", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Hierarchical Tensor Decomposition", "text": "In previous chapters, we introduced latent dirichlet allocation and its variations to model data with \u201cshallow\u201d structure, for instance, multi-view model.

Latent tree graphical models characterize a probability distribution involving observed and hidden variables which are Markovian on a tree.

Our consistency guarantees are applicable to a broad class of linear multivariate latent tree models including discrete distributions, continuous multivariate distributions (e.g. Gaussian), and mixed distributions such as Gaussian mixtures. This model class is much more general than discrete models, prevalent in most of the previous works on latent tree models [128, 127, 59, 17]. Third, our algorithm considers the inverse method of moments, and estimates the model parameters via tensor decomposition with low perturbation guarantees. Moreover, we carefully integrate structure learning with parameter estimation, based on tensor spectral decompositions [11]. Finally, our approach has a high degree of parallelism, and is bulk asynchronous parallel [65].\nIn addition to the aforementioned technical contributions, we showcase the impact of our work by applying it to two real datasets originating from the healthcare domain. The algorithm was used to discover hidden patterns, or concepts reflecting co-occurrences of particular diagnoses in patients in outpatient and intensive care settings. While such a task is currently done through manual analysis of the data, our method provides an automated method for the discovery of novel clinical concepts from high dimensional, multi-modal data.\n104\nOur overall approach follows a \u201cdivide-and-conquer\u201d strategy that learns models over small groups of variables and iteratively merges into a global solution.

Let T := (V, E) denote an undirected tree with vertex set V and edge set E . The neighborhood of a node vi, nbd(vi), is the set of nodes to which vi is directly connected on the tree. Leaves which have a common neighboring node are known as siblings, and the common node is referred to as their parent. Let N denote the number of samples. An example of latent tree is depicted in Figure 5.2(a).\n105\nThere are two types of variables on the nodes, namely, the observable variables, denoted by X := {x1, . . . , xp} (p := |X |), and hidden variables, denoted by H := {h1, . . . , hm} (m := |H|). Let Y := X \u222a H denote the complete set of variables and let yi denote the random variable at node vi \u2208 V, and similarly let yA denote the set of random variables in set A.\nA graphical model is defined as follows: given the neighborhood nbd(vi) of any node vi \u2208 V, the variable yi is conditionally independent of the rest of the variables in V, i.e., yi \u22a5 yj|ynbd(vi), \u2200vj \u2208 V\\ {vi \u222a nbd(vi)}.\nLinear Models We consider the class of linear latent tree models. The observed variables xi are random vectors of length di, i.e., xi \u2208 Rdi , \u2200i \u2208 [p] while the latent nodes are k-state categorical variables, i.e., hi \u2208 {e1, . . . , ek}, where ej \u2208 Rk is the jth standard basis vector. Although di can vary across variables, we use d for notation simplicity. In other words, for notation simplicity, xi \u2208 Rd, \u2200i \u2208 [p] is equivalent to xi \u2208 Rdi , \u2200i \u2208 [p].

Information distance roughly measures the extent of correlation between different pairs of observed variables and requires SVD computations in step (a). Then in step (b) a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is constructed over observable variables in parallel [24] using the multivariate information distance. The local groups are also obtained through MST so that they are available for the structure and parameter learning step that follows.\nThe structure and parameter learning is done jointly through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Step-(c) illustrates the divide step (or local learning), where local structure and parameter estimation is performed. It also performs the local merge to obtain group level structure and parameter estimates. After the local structure and parameter learning is finished within the\n107\ngroups, we perform merge operations among groups, again guided by the Minimum Spanning Tree structure.

For latent tree models, structure can be estimated via distance based methods. This involves computing certain information distances between any pair of observed variables, and then finding a tree which fits the computed distances.\nMultivariate information distances: We propose an additive distance for multivariate linear latent tree models. For a pair of (observed or hidden) variables ya and yb, consider the pairwise correlation matrix E [ yay \u22a4 b ] (the expectation is over samples). Note that its rank is k, dimension of the hidden variables.\nDefinition 5.1. The multivariate information distance between nodes i and j is defined as\ndist(va, vb) := \u2212 log\nk\u220f i=1 \u03c3i ( E(yay \u22a4 b ) )\n\u221a det(E(yay\u22a4a )) det(E(yby \u22a4 b ))\n(5.3)\nwhere {\u03c31(\u00b7), . . . , \u03c3k(\u00b7)} are the top k singular values.\nNote that definition 5.1 suggests that this multivariate information distance allows heterogeneous settings where the dimensions of ya and yb are different (and \u2265 k).\n108\nFor latent tree models, we can find information distances which are provably additive on the underlying tree in expectation, i.e. the expected distance between any two nodes in the tree is the sum of distances along the path between them.\nLemma 5.1. The multivariate information distance is additive on the tree T , i.e., dist(va, vc) = dist(va, vb) + dist(vb, vc), where vb is a node in the path from va to vc and va,vb,vc \u2208 V.\nRefer to Appendix D.1 for proof. The empirical distances can be computed via rank-k SVD of the empirical pairwise moment matrix E\u0302[yay \u22a4 b ] Note that the distances for all the pairs can be computed in parallel.\nFormation of local groups via MST: Once the empirical distances are computed, we construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), based on those distances. Note that the MST can be computed efficiently in parallel [156, 122]. We now form groups of observed variables over which we carry out learning independently, without any coordination. These groups are obtained by the (closed) neigborhoods in the MST, i.e. an internal node and its one-hop neighbors form a group. The corresponding internal node is referred to as the group leader. See Figure 5.2(b).\nLocal recursive grouping (LRG): Once the groups are constructed via neighborhoods of MST, we construct a sub-tree with hidden variables in each group (in parallel) using the recursive grouping introduced in [41]. The recursive grouping uses the multivariate information distances and decides the locations and numbers of hidden nodes. It proceeds by deciding which nodes are siblings, which proceeds as follows: consider two observed nodes vi, vj which are siblings on the tree with a common parent vl, and consider any other observed node va. From additivity of the (expected) information distances, we have dist(vi, va) = dist(vi, vl) + dist(vl, va) and similarly for dist(vj , va). Thus, we have \u03a6(vi, vj; va) := dist(vi, va) \u2212 dist(vj, va) = dist(vi, vl) \u2212 dist(vj , vl), which is independent of node va. Thus, comparing the quantity \u03a6(vi, vj ; va) for different nodes va allows us to\n109\nconclude that vi and vj are siblings. Once the siblings are inferred, the hidden nodes are introduced, and the same procedure repeats to construct the higher layers. Note that whenever we introduce a new hidden node hnew as a parent, we need to estimate multivariate information distance between hnew and nodes in active set \u2126. This is discussed in [41] with details.\nWe will describe the LRG in details with integrated parameters estimation in Procudure 6 in Section 5.5. In the end, we obtain a sub-tree over the local group of variables. After this local recursive grouping test, we store the neighborhood relationship for the leader vi using an adjacency list N i. We call the resultant local structure as latent sub-tree."}, {"heading": "5.4 Parameter Estimation", "text": "Along with the structure learning, we adopt a moment-based spectral learning technique for parameter estimation. This is a guaranteed and fast approach to recover parameters via moment matching for third order moments of the observed data. In contrast, traditional approaches such as Expectation Maximization (EM) suffer from spurious local optima and cannot provably recover the parameters.\nA latent tree with three leaves: We first consider an example of three observable leaves x1, x2, x3 (i.e., a triplet) with a common hidden parent h. We then clarify how this can be generalized to learn the parameters of the latent tree model. Let \u2297 denote for the tensor product. For example, if x1, x2, x3 \u2208 Rd, we have x1 \u2297 x2 \u2297 x3 \u2208 Rd\u00d7d\u00d7d.\nProperty 5.1 (Tensor decomposition for triplets).

The tensor decomposition method of [11] provably recovers the parameters Axi|h, \u2200i \u2208 [3], and P[h].\nTensor decomposition for learning latent tree models: We employ the above approach for learning latent tree model parameters as follows: for every triplet of variables ya, yb, and yc (hidden or observed), we consider the hidden variable hi which is the joining point of ya, yb and yc on the tree. They form a triplet model, for which we employ the tensor decomposition procedure. However, it is wasteful to do it over all the triplets in the latent tree.\nIn the next section, we demonstrate how we efficiently estimate the parameters as we learn the structure, and minimize the tensor decompositions required for estimation. Issues such as alignment of hidden labels across different decompositions will also be addressed."}, {"heading": "5.5 Integrated Structure and Parameter Estimation", "text": "So far, we described high-level procedures of structure estimation through local recursive grouping (LRG) and parameter estimation through tensor decomposition over triplets of variables, respectively.

Intuitively, we find efficient groups of triplets to carry out tensor decomposition simultaneously, as we estimate the structure through recursive grouping. In\n111\nrecursive grouping, pairs of nodes are recursively grouped as siblings or as parent-child. As this process continues, we carry out tensor decompositions whenever there are siblings present as triplets. If there are only a pair of siblings, we find an observed node with closest distance to the pair. Once the tensor decompositions are carried out on the observed nodes, we proceed to structure and parameter estimation of the added hidden variables. The samples of the hidden variables can be obtained via the posterior distribution, which is learnt earlier through tensor decomposition. This allows us to predict information distances and third order moments among the hidden variables as process continues.

More importantly, EM can only be applied on a stable structure since it is a global update procedure. Our proposed spectral learning method, in contrast, is applied locally over small groups of variables, and is a guaranteed learning with sufficient number of samples [11]. Moreover, since\n112\nwe integrate structure and parameter learning, we avoid recomputing the same quantities, e.g. SVD computations are required both for structure estimation (for computing distances) and parameter estimation (for whitening the tensor). Combining these operations results in huge computational savings (see Section 5.6 for the exact computational complexity of our method).\nProcedure 7 Merging and Alignment Correction (MAC) Input: Latent sub-trees N i for all internal nodes i.

The challenge now is to combine them to obtain a globally consistent estimate. There are non-trivial obstacles to achieving this: first, the constructed local sub-trees span overlapping groups of observed nodes, and possess conflicting paths. Second, local parameters need to be re-aligned as we merge the subtrees to obtain globally consistent estimates due to the nature of unsupervised learning. To be precise, different tensor decompositions lead to permutation of the hidden labels (i.e. columns of the transition matrices) across triplets. Thus, we need to find the permutation matrix correcting the alignment of hidden states of the transition matrices, so as to guarantee global consistency.\n113\nStructure Union: We now describe the procedure to merge the local structures. We merge them in pairs to obtain the final global latent tree. Recall that N i denotes a sub-tree constructed locally over a group, whose leader is node vi. Consider a pair of subtrees N i and N j, whose group leaders vi and vj are neighbors on the MST. Since vi and vj are neighbors, both the sub-trees contain them, and have different paths between them (with hidden variables added). Moreover, note that this is the only conflicting path in the two subtrees. We now describe how we can resolve this: in N i, let hi1 be the neighboring hidden node for vi and h i 2 be the neighbor of vj . There could be more hidden nodes between h i 1 and hi2. Similarly, in N i, let hj1 and hj2 be the corresponding nodes in N j. The shortest path between vi and vj in the two sub-trees are given as follows:\npath(vi, vj;N i) := [vi \u2212 hi1 \u2212 . . .\u2212 hi2 \u2212 vj] (5.5) path(vi, vj ;N j) := [vi \u2212 hj1 \u2212 . . .\u2212 hj2 \u2212 vj] (5.6)\nThen the union path is formed as follows:\nmerge(path(vi, vj;N i), path(vi, vj;N j))\n:= [vi \u2212 hi1 \u2212 . . .\u2212 hi2 \u2212 hj1 . . . hj2 \u2212 vj] (5.7)\nIn other words, we retain the immediate hidden neighbor of each group leader, and break the paths on the other end. For example in Figure 5.2(d1,d2), we have the path v3\u2212h1\u2212 v5 in N 3 and path v3 \u2212 h3 \u2212 h2 \u2212 v5 in N 5. The resulting path is v3 \u2212 h1 \u2212 h3 \u2212 h2 \u2212 v5, as see in Figure 5.2(e). After the union of the conflicting paths, the other nodes are attached to the resultant latent tree. We present the pseudo code in Procedure 7 in Appendix D.5.\nParameter Alignment Correction: As mentioned before, our parameter estimation is unsupervised, and therefore, columns of the estimated transition matrices may be permuted for different triplets over which tensor decomposition is carried out. Note that the parameter\n114\nProcedure 8 Parameter Alignment Correction (Gr denotes reference group, Go denotes the list of other groups, each group has a reference node denoted as Rl, and the reference node in Gr is Rg.

We refer to this as the alignment issue and it is required at various levels.\nThere are two types of triplets, namely, in-group and out-group triplets. A triplet of nodes Trip(yi, yj, yl) is said to be in-group (denoted by Tripin(yi, yj, yl) ) if its containing nodes share a joint node hk and there are no other hidden nodes in path(yi, hk), path(yj, hk) or path(yl, hk). Otherwise, this triplet is out-group denoted by Tripout(yi, yj, yl). We define a group as sufficient children group if it contains at least three in-group nodes.\nDesigning an in-group alignment correction with sufficient children is relatively simple: we achieve this by including a local reference node for all the in-group triplets. Thus, all the triplets are aligned with the reference node. The alignment correction is more challenging if lacking sufficient children. We propose out-group alignment to solve this problem. We first assign one group as a reference group, and the local reference node in that reference group becomes the global reference node. In this way, we align all recovered transition matrices\n115\nin the same order of hidden states as in the reference node.

The smaller the metric is, the better the recovered tree is. We also compare our results with a baseline: the agglomerative clustering. The proposed method are slightly better than the baseline and the advantage is increased with more nodes. However, the proposed method provides an efficient probabilistic graphical model that can support general inference which is beyond the baseline.\nQualitative analysis The qualitative analysis is done by a senior MD-PhD student in our team.\n2The ground truth tree is the PheWAS hierarchy provided in the clinical study [54]\n119\n(a) Case d=2: Here we report the results from the 2-dimensional case (i.e., observed variable is binary). In figure 5.4, we show a portion of the learned tree using the MIMIC2 healthcare\ndata. The yellow nodes are latent nodes from the learned subtrees while the blue nodes represent observed nodes(diagnosis codes) in the original dataset. Diagnoses that are similar were generally grouped together. For example, many neoplastic diseases were grouped under the same latent node (node 1135). While some dissimilar diseases were grouped together, there usually exists a known or plausible association of the diseases in the clinical setting. For example, in figure 5.4, clotting-related diseases and altered mental status were grouped under the same latent node as several neoplasms. This may reflect the fact that altered mental status and clotting conditions such as thrombophlebitis can occur as complications of neoplastic diseases [61]. The association of malignant neoplasms of prostate and colon polyps, two common cancers in males, is captured under latent node 1136 [74].\n120\n(b) Case d =31: We also learn a tree from the MIMIC2 dataset, in which we grouped diseases into 163 pheWAS codes and up to 31 dimensions per variable. Figure 5.5 shows a portion of the learned tree of four subtrees which all reflect similar diseases relating to trauma. A majority of the learned subtrees reflected clinically meaningful concepts, in that related and commonly co-occurring diseases tended to group together in the same subtrees or in nearby subtrees. We also learn the disease tree from the larger CMS dataset, in which we group diseases into 168 variables and up to 31 dimensions per variable. Similar to the case from the MIMIC2 dataset, a majority of learned subtrees reflected clinically meaningful concepts.\nFor both the MIMIC2 and CMS datasets, we performed a qualitative comparison of the resulting trees while varying the hidden dimension k for the algorithm. The resulting trees for different values of k did not exhibit significant differences. This implies that our algorithm is robust with different choices of hidden dimensions. The estimated model parameters are also robust for different values of k based on the results.\n121\nScalability Our algorithm is scalable w.r.t. varying characteristics of the input data. First, it can handle a large number of patients efficiently, as shown in Figure 5.3(a). It has also a linear scaling behavior as we vary the number observed nodes, as shown in Figure 5.3(b). Furthermore, even in cases where the number of observed variables is large, our method maintains an almost linear scale-up as we vary the computational power available, as shown in Figure 5.3(c).

These cells are specialized into a surprising diversity of cell types. The retina alone boasts well over 50 cell types, and it is an active area of research to perform a census of the various neuronal cell types that comprise the central nervous system. Many criteria have been used to categorize neuronal cell types, from neuronal morphology and connectivity to their functional response properties. Neurons can also be categorized based on the proteins they make. Immunohistochemistry has been used with great success for many decades to differentiate excitatory neurons from inhibitory neurons by labeling for known proteins involved in the synthesis and regulation of glutamate and GABA, the primary excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters respectively.\nMore recently, there has been an effort to systematically measure the complete transcriptome of single neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is an extremely powerful technique that can quantitatively determine the expression level of every gene that is expressed in individual neurons. This so-called transcriptome or gene expression / transcription profile can then be used to define cell types by clustering. A recent study produced the most comprehensive census of cell types to date in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampus\n124\nby performing single-cell RNA-Seq on over 3000 neurons [168]. While this study is quite exciting, tyring to replicate it for all brain regions might well require the equivalent of a thousand such experiments. Thus, it is likely that the unprecedented insights that RNA-Seq can provide will be slow to arrive. More importantly, single cell sequencing methods are not currently able to capture the precise three-dimensional location of the individual neurons.\nHere we propose a complementary approach that uses computational strategies to identify cell types and their spatial distribution by re-analysing data published by the Allen Institute for Brain Research. The Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) contains cellular resolution brain-wide insitu hybridization (ISH) images for 20,000 genes1. ISH is a histological technique that labels the mRNA in all cells expressing the corresponding gene in a manner roughly proportion to the gene expression level. An example of an ISH image can be seen in figure 6.1(a).\nThe ABA contains genome-wide and brain-wide ISH images of the adult mouse brain. These images were generated by slicing the brain into a series of 25 \u00b5m thin sections and performing ISH. Image series of ISH performed for different genes come from different mouse brains, since ISH can only be performed for one gene at a time. The ISH image series for different genes were then computational aligned into a common reference brain coordinate system. Such data have been productively used to infer the average transcriptomes corresponding to different brain regions.\nIt is commonly thought that the ABA cannot be used to infer the transcriptomes of individual cells in a given brain region since mouse brains cannot be aligned to the precision of a single cell. This is because there is individual variation in the precise number and location of neurons from brain to brain. However, we expect that the average number and spatial distribution of neurons from each cell type to be conserved from brain to brain, for a given brain area. More concretely, we might expect that parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory\n1 Although the Atlas contains ISH data for approximately 20,000 distinct mouse genes, we focus on the top 1743 reliable genes whose sagittal and coronal experiments are highly correlated.\n125\ninterneurons in layer 2/3 of the mouse somatosensory cortex comprise approximately 7% of all neurons and have a conserved spatial and size distribution from brain to brain. We use this fact to derive a method for simultaneously inferring the cell types in a given brain region and their gene expression profiles from the ABA.\nWe propose to model the spatial distribution of neurons in a brain as being generated by sampling from an unknown but consistent brain-region and cell-type dependent spatial point process distribution. And since each gene might only be expressed in a subset of cell types, an ISH image for a single gene can be thought of as a mixture of spatial point processes where the mixture weights represent the individual cell types expressing that gene. We infer cell types, their gene expression profiles and their spatial distribution by unmixing the spatial point processes corresponding to the ISH images for 1743 genes. This is in notable contrast to the information provided by single-cell RNA sequencing which can only measure the gene expression profile of individual cells to high accuracy but where, due to the destructive measurement process, all information about the spatial position and distribution of cell types is lost."}, {"heading": "6.1.2 Previous Work", "text": "Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) [115] is a landmark study which mapped the gene expression of about 20,000 genes across the entire mouse brain. The ABA dataset consists of cellular high-resolution 2d imagery of in-situ hybridized series of brain sections, digitally aligned to a common reference atlas. However, since the in-situ images for each gene come from different mouse brains and since there is significant variability in the individual locations of labeled cells, it is not possible to register brain-wide gene expression at a resolution higher than about 250\u00b5m. Therefore, the cellular resolution detail was down-sampled to construct\n126\na coarser 3d representation of the average gene expression level in 250\u00b5m\u00d7 250\u00b5m\u00d7 250\u00b5m voxels.\nThe coarse-resolution averaged gene expression representation has been widely used and analyzed to understand differences in gene expression at the level of brain region. Hawrylycz et al [79] analyzed the correlational structure of gene expression at this scale, across the entire mouse brain. However, due to the poor resolution of the average gene expression representation, it has proven challenging to use the ABA to discover the microstructure of gene expression within a brain region. To address this issue from a complementary perspective, Grange et al [72] used the gene expression profiles of 64 known cell-types, combined with linear unmixing to determine the spatial distribution of these known cell-types. However, such an approach can be confounded by the presence of cell-types whose expression profiles have yet to be characterized, and limited by the resolution of the averaged gene expression representation.\nIn contrast to previous approaches, we aim to solve the difficult problem of automatically discovering the gene expression profiles of cell-types within a brain region by analyzing the original cellular resolution ISH imagery. We propose to use the spatial distributions of labeled cells, and their shapes and sizes, which are a far richer representation than simply the average expression level in 250\u00b5m\u00d7 250\u00b5m\u00d7 250\u00b5m voxels. This spatial point process is then un-mixed to determine the gene expression profile of cell types.\nMost previous work on unmixing point process mixtures adopted parametric generative models where the point process is limited to some distribution family such as Poisson or Gaussian [95, 107]. However, since we are not interested in building a generative model of a point process, but rather care more about inferring the mixing proportions (gene expression profile), we take a simpler parameter-free approach. This approach models only the statistics of the point process, but is not a generative model, and so cannot be use to model individual points/cells.\n127\n128"}, {"heading": "6.2 Modeling the Spatial Distribution of Cell-types Us-", "text": "ing Spatial Point Process Features\nMost analyses of the ABA in situ hybridization dataset have utilized a simple measure of average expression level in relatively large 250\u00b5m\u00d7 250\u00b5m\u00d7 250\u00b5m voxels of brain tissue. Due to the large volume over which the expression level is averaged, such a representation cannot distinguish between large numbers of cells expressing small amounts of RNA vs. small numbers of cells expressing large amounts of RNA.

But since we are not interested in directly modeling the individual labeled cells, but instead in modeling only their aggregate spatial statistics, and in inferring their gene expression profiles, we can take a simpler approach.\nWe use a joint histogram simple statistics of the collection of detected cells to characterize the underlying point process from which they are drawn. This is an empirical moment approach which side-steps the need to carefully define a generative point process distribution.\nAs we describe in the next section, we propose to model the point process measured from the ISH image for each gene as a mixture of point processes belonging to individual cell-types. For this, we use a linear mixing model, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. The use of this model is greatly simplified if we carefully choose our feature representation such that the linear mixture of point processes results in a linear mixture of histogram statistics. This is clearly the case for the features we have chosen. For instance, if we sample equally from\n130\ntwo point process distributions P1 and P2 with average densities of d1 and d2, the addition of these two point processes P = P1+P2 results in the addition of the two densities d = d1+d2.

We place a symmetric Dirichlet prior over cell-type multinomial distribution hm for a given histogram bin m. This assumes that the number of cell-types expressing each gene is the same for all genes. But since some genes are expressed more commonly and non-specifically than others, we might expect a gene-specific prior to be a better model.

May the world be more intelligent!\n142"}, {"heading": "Appendix A", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Appendix for Online Stochastic", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Gradient for Tensor Decomposition", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.1 Detailed Analysis for Section 2.2 in Unconstrained", "text": "Case\nIn this section we give detailed analysis for noisy gradient descent, under the assumption that the unconstrained problem satisfies (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle property.\nThe algorithm we investigate in Algorithm 1, we can combine the randomness in the stochastic gradient oracle and the artificial noise, and rewrite the update equation in form:\nwt = wt\u22121 \u2212 \u03b7(\u2207f(wt\u22121) + \u03bet\u22121) (A.1)\nwhere \u03b7 is step size, \u03be = SG(wt\u22121) \u2212 \u2207f(wt\u22121) + n (recall n is a random vector on unit sphere) is the combination of two source of noise.\n156\nBy assumption, we know \u03be\u2019s are independent and they satisfying E\u03be = 0, \u2016\u03be\u2016 \u2264 Q+ 1. Due to the explicitly added noise in Algorithm 1, we further have E\u03be\u03beT \u227b 1 d I. For simplicity, we assume E\u03be\u03beT = \u03c32I, for some constant \u03c3 = \u0398\u0303(1), then the algorithm we are running is exactly the same as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Our proof can be very easily extended to the case when 1 d I E[\u03be\u03beT ] (Q + 1 d )I because both the upper and lower bounds are \u0398\u0303(1).\nWe first restate the main theorem in the context of stochastic gradient descent.\nTheorem A.1 (Main Theorem). Suppose a function f(w) : Rd \u2192 R that is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)strict saddle, and has a stochastic gradient oracle where the noise satisfy E\u03be\u03beT = \u03c32I. Further, suppose the function is bounded by |f(w)| \u2264 B, is \u03b2-smooth and has \u03c1-Lipschitz Hessian. Then there exists a threshold \u03b7max = \u0398\u0303(1), so that for any \u03b6 > 0, and for any \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b7max/max{1, log(1/\u03b6)}, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b6 in t = O\u0303(\u03b7\u22122 log(1/\u03b6)) iterations, SGD outputs a point wt that is O\u0303( \u221a \u03b7 log(1/\u03b7\u03b6))-close to some local minimum w\u22c6.\nRecall that O\u0303(\u00b7) (\u2126\u0303, \u0398\u0303) hides the factor that has polynomial dependence on all other parameters, but is independent of \u03b7 and \u03b6 . So it focuses on the dependency on \u03b7 and \u03b6 . Throughout the proof, we interchangeably use both H(w) and \u22072f(w) to represent the Hessian matrix of f(w).\nAs we discussed in the proof sketch in Section 2.2, we analyze the behavior of the algorithm in three different cases. The first case is when the gradient is large.\nLemma A.1.

Our assumption can guarantee \u03b7max < 1 \u03b2 , then by update equation Eq.(A.1), we have:\nEf(w1)\u2212 f(w0) \u2264 \u2207f(w0)TE(w1 \u2212 w0) + \u03b2\n2 E\u2016w1 \u2212 w0\u20162\n= \u2207f(w0)TE (\u2212\u03b7(\u2207f(w0) + \u03be0)) + \u03b2\n2 E \u2016\u2212\u03b7(\u2207f(w0) + \u03be0)\u20162\n= \u2212(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b7 2\n2 )\u2016\u2207f(w0)\u20162 +\n\u03b72\u03c32\u03b2d\n2\n\u2264 \u2212\u03b7 2 \u2016\u2207f(w0)\u20162 +\n\u03b72\u03c32\u03b2d\n2 \u2264 \u2212\u03b7\n2\u03c32\u03b2d\n2 (A.3)\nwhich finishes the proof.\nLemma A.2. Under the assumptions of Theorem A.1, for any initial point w0 that is O\u0303( \u221a \u03b7) < \u03b4 close to a local minimum w\u22c6, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b6/2, we have following holds simultaneously:\n\u2200t \u2264 O\u0303( 1 \u03b72 log 1 \u03b6 ), \u2016wt \u2212 w\u22c6\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\n\u221a \u03b7 log 1\n\u03b7\u03b6 ) < \u03b4 (A.4)\nwhere w\u22c6 is the locally optimal point.\nProof. We shall construct a supermartingale and use Azuma\u2019s inequality [21] to prove this result.\nLet filtration Ft = \u03c3{\u03be0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03bet\u22121}, and note \u03c3{\u22060, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u2206t} \u2282 Ft, where \u03c3{\u00b7} denotes the sigma field.

To ensure the correctness of proof, O\u0303 notation in this proof will never hide any dependence on \u00b5. Clearly there\u2019s always a small enough choice of \u03b7max = \u0398\u0303(1) to make \u00b5 \u221a \u03b7 log 1 \u03b7\u03b6 < \u03b4 holds as long as \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b7max/max{1, log(1/\u03b6)}.

Also because E\u03be = 0 and \u2016\u03be\u2016 \u2264 Q = O\u0303(1) with probability 1, then by Hoeffding inequality, we have for each dimension i and time t \u2264 T :\nP ( |\u03b7 t\u22121\u2211\n\u03c4=0\n(1\u2212 \u03b7H)t\u2212\u03c4\u22121\u03be\u03c4,i| > O\u0303(\u03b7 1 2 log\n1 \u03b7 )\n) \u2264 e\u2212\u2126\u0303(log2 1\u03b7 ) \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b74) (A.28)\nthen by summing over dimension d and taking union bound over all t \u2264 T , we directly have:\nP ( \u2200t \u2264 T, \u2016\u03b7 t\u22121\u2211\n\u03c4=0\n(1\u2212 \u03b7H)t\u2212\u03c4\u22121\u03be\u03c4\u2016 > O\u0303(\u03b7 1 2 log\n1 \u03b7 )\n) \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b73). (A.29)\nCombine this fact with Eq.(A.24) and Eq.(A.25), we finish the proof.\nNext we need to prove that the two sequences of updates are always close.\nLemma A.5. Under the assumptions of Theorem A.1. and let {wt} be the corresponding sequence generated by running SGD on function f . Also let f\u0303 and {w\u0303t} be defined as in Lemma A.4. Then, for any initial point w0 where \u2016\u2207f(w0)\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b7) < \u01eb, and \u03bbmin(\u22072f(w0)) = \u2212\u03b30. Given the choice of T as in Eq.(A.21), with probability at least 1\u2212 O\u0303(\u03b72), we have following holds simultaneously for all t \u2264 T :\n\u2016wt \u2212 w\u0303t\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b7 log2 1\n\u03b7 ); \u2016\u2207f(wt)\u2212\u2207f\u0303(w\u0303t)\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b7 log2\n1 \u03b7 ) (A.30)\nProof. First, we have update function of gradient by:\n\u2207f(wt) =\u2207f(wt\u22121) + \u222b 1\n0\nH(wt\u22121 + t(wt \u2212 wt\u22121))dt \u00b7 (wt \u2212 wt\u22121)\n=\u2207f(wt\u22121) +H(wt\u22121)(wt \u2212 wt\u22121) + \u03b8t\u22121 (A.31)\n164\nwhere the remainder:\n\u03b8t\u22121 \u2261 \u222b 1\n0\n[H(wt\u22121 + t(wt \u2212 wt\u22121))\u2212H(wt\u22121)] dt \u00b7 (wt \u2212 wt\u22121) (A.32)\nDenote H = H(w0), and H\u2032t\u22121 = H(wt\u22121)\u2212H(w0). By Hessian smoothness, we immediately have:\n\u2016H\u2032t\u22121\u2016 = \u2016H(wt\u22121)\u2212H(w0)\u2016 \u2264 \u03c1\u2016wt\u22121 \u2212 w0\u2016 \u2264 \u03c1(\u2016wt \u2212 w\u0303t\u2016+ \u2016w\u0303t \u2212 w0\u2016) (A.33) \u2016\u03b8t\u22121\u2016 \u2264 \u03c1\n2 \u2016wt \u2212 wt\u22121\u20162 (A.34)\nSubstitute the update equation of SGD (Eq.(A.1)) into Eq.(A.31), we have:\n\u2207f(wt) = \u2207f(wt\u22121)\u2212 \u03b7(H +H\u2032t\u22121)(\u2207f(wt\u22121) + \u03bet\u22121) + \u03b8t\u22121\n= (1\u2212 \u03b7H)\u2207f(wt\u22121)\u2212 \u03b7H\u03bet\u22121 \u2212 \u03b7H\u2032t\u22121(\u2207f(wt\u22121) + \u03bet\u22121) + \u03b8t\u22121 (A.35)\nLet \u2206t = \u2207f(wt)\u2212\u2207f\u0303(w\u0303t) denote the difference in gradient, then from Eq.(A.24), Eq.(A.35), and Eq.(A.1), we have:\n\u2206t = (1\u2212 \u03b7H)\u2206t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b7H\u2032t\u22121[\u2206t\u22121 +\u2207f\u0303(w\u0303t\u22121) + \u03bet\u22121] + \u03b8t\u22121 (A.36) wt \u2212 w\u0303t = \u2212\u03b7 t\u22121\u2211\n\u03c4=0\n\u2206\u03c4 (A.37)\nLet filtration Ft = \u03c3{\u03be0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03bet\u22121}, and note \u03c3{\u22060, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u2206t} \u2282 Ft, where \u03c3{\u00b7} denotes the sigma field. Also, let event Kt = {\u2200\u03c4 \u2264 t, \u2016\u2207f\u0303(w\u0303\u03c4)\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b7 1 2 log 1 \u03b7 ), \u2016w\u0303\u03c4 \u2212 w0\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b7 1 2 log 1\n\u03b7 )}, and Et = {\u2200\u03c4 \u2264 t, \u2016\u2206\u03c4\u2016 \u2264 \u00b5\u03b7 log2 1\u03b7}, where \u00b5 is independent of (\u03b7, \u03b6),\nand will be specified later. Again, O\u0303 notation in this proof will never hide any dependence\n165\non \u00b5. Clearly, we have Kt \u2282 Kt\u22121 (Et \u2282 Et\u22121), thus 1Kt \u2264 1Kt\u22121 (1Et \u2264 1Et\u22121), where 1K is the indicator function of event K.\nWe first need to carefully bounded all terms in Eq.(A.36), conditioned on event Kt\u22121 \u2229Et\u22121, by Eq.(A.33), Eq.(A.34)), and Eq.(A.37), with probability 1, for all t \u2264 T \u2264 O(log d/\u03b30\u03b7), we have:\n\u2016(1\u2212 \u03b7H)\u2206t\u22121\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u00b5\u03b7 log2 1 \u03b7 ) \u2016\u03b7H\u2032t\u22121(\u2206t\u22121 +\u2207f\u0303(w\u0303t\u22121))\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b72 log2 1 \u03b7 )\n\u2016\u03b7H\u2032t\u22121\u03bet\u22121\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b71.5 log 1\n\u03b7 ) \u2016\u03b8t\u22121\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b72) (A.38)\nSince event Kt\u22121 \u2282 Ft\u22121,Et\u22121 \u2282 Ft\u22121 thus independent of \u03bet\u22121, we also have:\nE[((1\u2212 \u03b7H)\u2206t\u22121)T\u03b7H\u2032t\u22121\u03bet\u221211Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 | Ft\u22121]\n=1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121((1\u2212 \u03b7H)\u2206t\u22121)T\u03b7H\u2032t\u22121E[\u03bet\u22121 | Ft\u22121] = 0 (A.39)\nTherefore, from Eq.(A.36) and Eq.(A.38):\nE[\u2016\u2206t\u2016221Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 | Ft\u22121]\n\u2264 [ (1 + \u03b7\u03b30) 2\u2016\u2206t\u22121\u20162 + (1 + \u03b7\u03b30)\u2016\u2206t\u22121\u2016O\u0303(\u03b72 log2 1\n\u03b7 ) + O\u0303(\u03b73 log2\n1 \u03b7 )\n] 1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121\n\u2264 [ (1 + \u03b7\u03b30) 2\u2016\u2206t\u22121\u20162 + O\u0303(\u00b5\u03b73 log4 1\n\u03b7 )\n] 1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 (A.40)\nDefine\nGt = (1 + \u03b7\u03b30) \u22122t[ \u2016\u2206t\u20162 + \u03b1\u03b72 log4\n1 \u03b7 ] (A.41)\n166\nThen, when \u03b7max is small enough, we have:\nE[Gt1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 | Ft\u22121] = (1 + \u03b7\u03b30)\u22122t [ E[\u2016\u2206t\u2016221Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 | Ft\u22121] + \u03b1\u03b72 log3 1\n\u03b7\n] 1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121\n\u2264 (1 + \u03b7\u03b30)\u22122t [ (1 + \u03b7\u03b30) 2\u2016\u2206t\u22121\u20162 + O\u0303(\u00b5\u03b73 log4 1\n\u03b7 ) + \u03b1\u03b72 log4\n1 \u03b7\n] 1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121\n\u2264 (1 + \u03b7\u03b30)\u22122t [ (1 + \u03b7\u03b30) 2\u2016\u2206t\u22121\u20162 + (1 + \u03b7\u03b30)2\u03b1\u03b72 log4 1\n\u03b7\n] 1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121\n= Gt\u221211Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 \u2264 Gt\u221211Kt\u22122\u2229Et\u22122 (A.42)\nTherefore, we have E[Gt1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 | Ft\u22121] \u2264 Gt\u221211Kt\u22122\u2229Et\u22122 which means Gt1Kt\u22121\u2229Et\u22121 is a supermartingale.\nOn the other hand, we have:\n\u2206t = (1\u2212 \u03b7H)\u2206t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b7H\u2032t\u22121(\u2206t\u22121 +\u2207f\u0303(w\u0303t\u22121))\u2212 \u03b7H\u2032t\u22121\u03bet\u22121 + \u03b8t\u22121 (A.43)\nOnce conditional on filtration Ft\u22121, the first two terms are deterministic, and only the third and fourth term are random.

Also, by Eq.(A.21), we also immediately have that T = O(log d/\u03b30\u03b7) \u2264 O(log d/\u03b3\u03b7). Therefore, by choose Tmax = O(log d/\u03b3\u03b7) with large enough constant, we have T \u2264 Tmax = O(log d/\u03b3\u03b7).\nFor bounding the second term, by definition of Et, we have:\nE\u039b1ET = E [ \u2207f(w0)T \u03b4 + \u03b4\u0303TH\u03b4 + 1\n2 \u03b4TH\u03b4 + \u03c1 6 \u2016\u03b4\u0303 + \u03b4\u20163\n] 1ET \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b71.5 log3 1\n\u03b7 ) (A.55)\nOn the other hand, since noise is bounded as \u2016\u03be\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(1), from the results of Lemma A.4, it\u2019s easy to show \u2016w\u0303 \u2212 w0\u2016 = \u2016\u03b4\u0303\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(1) is also bounded with probability 1.

Let\u2019s set L1 = {w | \u2016\u2207f(w)\u2016 \u2265 \u221a 2\u03b7\u03c32\u03b2d}, L2 = {w | \u2016\u2207f(w)\u2016 \u2264 \u221a 2\u03b7\u03c32\u03b2d and \u03bbmin(H(w)) \u2264 \u2212\u03b3}, and L3 = Lc1 \u222a Lc2. By choosing small enough \u03b7max, we could make \u221a 2\u03b7\u03c32\u03b2d < min{\u01eb, \u03b1\u03b4}. Under this choice, we know from Definition 2.3 of (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddlethat L3 is the locally \u03b1-strongly convex region which is O\u0303(\u221a\u03b7)-close to some local minimum.\nWe shall first prove that within O\u0303( 1 \u03b72 log 1 \u03b6 ) steps with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b6/2 one of wt is in L3. Then by Lemma A.2 we know with probability at most \u03b6/2 there exists a wt that is in L3 but the last point is not. By union bound we will get the main result.\nTo prove within O\u0303( 1 \u03b72 log 1 \u03b6 ) steps with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b6/2 one of wt is in L3, we first show starting from any point, in O\u0303( 1 \u03b72 ) steps with probability at least 1/2 one of wt is in L3. Then we can repeat this log 1/\u03b6 times to get the high probability result.\nDefine stochastic process {\u03c4i} s.t. \u03c40 = 0, and\n\u03c4i+1 =    \u03c4i + 1 if w\u03c4i \u2208 L1 \u222a L3 \u03c4i + T (w\u03c4i) if w\u03c4i \u2208 L2 (A.57)\nWhere T (w\u03c4i) is defined by Eq.(A.21) with \u03b30 = \u03bbmin(H(w\u03c4i))and we know T \u2264 Tmax = O\u0303( 1\u03b7 ).\nBy Lemma A.1 and Lemma A.3, we know:\nE[f(w\u03c4i+1)\u2212 f(w\u03c4i)|w\u03c4i \u2208 L1,F\u03c4i\u22121] = E[f(w\u03c4i+1)\u2212 f(w\u03c4i)|w\u03c4i \u2208 L1] \u2264 \u2212O\u0303(\u03b72) (A.58) E[f(w\u03c4i+1)\u2212 f(w\u03c4i)|w\u03c4i \u2208 L2,F\u03c4i\u22121] = E[f(w\u03c4i+1)\u2212 f(w\u03c4i)|w\u03c4i \u2208 L2] \u2264 \u2212O\u0303(\u03b7) (A.59)\nTherefore, combine above equation, we have:\nE[f(w\u03c4i+1)\u2212 f(w\u03c4i)|w\u03c4i 6\u2208 L3,F\u03c4i\u22121] = E[f(w\u03c4i+1)\u2212 f(w\u03c4i)|w\u03c4i 6\u2208 L3] \u2264 \u2212(\u03c4i+1\u2212 \u03c4i)O\u0303(\u03b72)\n(A.60)\n171\nDefine event Ei = {\u2203j \u2264 i, w\u03c4j \u2208 L3}, clearly Ei \u2282 Ei+1, thus P (Ei) \u2264 P (Ei+1). Finally, consider f(w\u03c4i+1)1Ei, we have:\nEf(w\u03c4i+1)1Ei \u2212 Ef(w\u03c4i)1Ei\u22121 \u2264 B \u00b7 P (Ei \u2212 Ei\u22121) + E[f(w\u03c4i+1)\u2212 f(w\u03c4i)|Ei] \u00b7 P (Ei)\n\u2264 B \u00b7 P (Ei \u2212 Ei\u22121)\u2212 (\u03c4i+1 \u2212 \u03c4i)O\u0303(\u03b72)P (Ei) (A.61)\nTherefore, by summing up over i, we have:\nEf(w\u03c4i)1Ei \u2212 f(w0) \u2264 BP (Ei)\u2212 \u03c4iO\u0303(\u03b72)P (Ei) \u2264 B \u2212 \u03c4iO\u0303(\u03b72)P (Ei) (A.62)\nSince |f(w\u03c4i)1Ei| < B is bounded, as \u03c4i grows to as large as 6B\u03b72 , we must have P (Ei) < 12 . That is, after O\u0303( 1 \u03b72 ) steps, with at least probability 1/2, {wt} have at least enter L3 once. Since this argument holds for any starting point, we can repeat this log 1/\u03b6 times and we know after O\u0303( 1 \u03b72 log 1/\u03b6) steps, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b6/2, {wt} have at least enter L3 once.\nCombining with Lemma A.2, and by union bound we know after O\u0303( 1 \u03b72 log 1/\u03b6) steps, with probability at least 1\u2212\u03b6 , wt will be in the O\u0303( \u221a \u03b7 log 1\n\u03b7\u03b6 ) neigborhood of some local minimum."}, {"heading": "A.2 Detailed Analysis for Section 2.2 in Constrained", "text": "Case\nSo far, we have been discussed all about unconstrained problem.

LICQ (linear independent constraint quantification) is a common assumption in this context.\nDefinition A.1 (LICQ). In equality-constraint problem Eq.(A.63), given a point w, we say that the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) holds if the set of constraint gradients {\u2207ci(x), i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m} is linearly independent.\nIn constrained optimization, we can locally transform it to an unconstrained problem by introducing Lagrangian multipliers. The Langrangian L can be written as\nL(w, \u03bb) = f(w)\u2212 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbici(w) (A.66)\nThen, if LICQ holds for all w \u2208 W, we can properly define function \u03bb\u2217(\u00b7) to be:\n\u03bb\u2217(w) = argmin \u03bb\n\u2016\u2207f(w)\u2212 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi\u2207ci(w)\u2016 = argmin \u03bb \u2016\u2207wL(w, \u03bb)\u2016 (A.67)\nwhere \u03bb\u2217(\u00b7) can be calculated analytically: let matrix C(w) = (\u2207c1(w), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u2207cm(w)), then we have:\n\u03bb\u2217(w) = C(w)\u2020\u2207f(w) = (C(w)TC(w))\u22121C(w)T\u2207f(w) (A.68)\nwhere (\u00b7)\u2020 is Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse.\nIn our setting we need a stronger regularity condition which we call robust LICQ (RLICQ).\nDefinition A.2 ( \u03b1c-RLICQ ). In equality-constraint problem Eq.(A.63), given a point w, we say that \u03b1c-robust linear independence constraint qualification ( \u03b1c-RLICQ ) holds if the\n174\nminimum singular value of matrix C(w) = (\u2207c1(w), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u2207cm(w)) is greater or equal to \u03b1c, that is \u03c3min(C(w)) \u2265 \u03b1c.\nRemark. Given a point w \u2208 W, \u03b1c-RLICQ implies LICQ. While LICQ holds for all w \u2208 W is a necessary condition for \u03bb\u2217(w) to be well-defined; it\u2019s easy to check that \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all w \u2208 W is a necessary condition for \u03bb\u2217(w) to be bounded. Later, we will also see \u03b1c-RLICQ combined with the smoothness of {ci(w)}mi=1 guarantee the curvature of constraint manifold to be bounded everywhere.\nNote that we require this condition in order to provide a quantitative bound, without this assumption there can be cases that are exponentially close to a function that does not satisfy LICQ.\nWe can also write down the first-order and second-order partial derivative of Lagrangian L at point (w, \u03bb\u2217(w)):\n\u03c7(w) = \u2207wL(w, \u03bb)|(w,\u03bb\u2217(w)) = \u2207f(w)\u2212 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bb\u2217i (w)\u2207ci(w) (A.69)\nM(w) = \u22072wwL(w, \u03bb)|(w,\u03bb\u2217(w)) = \u22072f(w)\u2212 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bb\u2217i (w)\u22072ci(w) (A.70)\nDefinition A.3 (Tangent Space and Normal Space). Given a feasible point w \u2208 W, define its corresponding Tangent Space to be T (w) = {v | \u2207ci(w)Tv = 0; i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m}, and Normal Space to be T c(w) = span{\u2207c1(w) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u2207cm(w)}\nIf w \u2208 Rd, and we have m constraint satisfying \u03b1c-RLICQ , the tangent space would be a linear subspace with dimension d \u2212m; and the normal space would be a linear subspace with dimension m. We also know immediately that \u03c7(w) defined in Eq.(A.69) has another interpretation: it\u2019s the component of gradient \u2207f(w) in tangent space.\n175\nAlso, it\u2019s easy to see the normal space T c(w) is the orthogonal complement of T . We can also define the projection matrix of any vector onto tangent space (or normal space) to be PT (w) (or PT c(w)). Then, clearly, both PT (w) and PT c(w) are orthoprojector, thus symmetric. Also by Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\u2016v\u20162 = \u2016PT (w)v\u20162 + \u2016PT c(w)v\u20162, \u2200v \u2208 Rd (A.71)\nTaylor Expansion Let w,w0 \u2208 W, and fix \u03bb\u2217 = \u03bb\u2217(w0) independent of w, assume\u22072wwL(w, \u03bb\u2217) is \u03c1L-Lipschitz, that is \u2016\u22072wwL(w1, \u03bb\u2217)\u2212\u22072wwL(w2, \u03bb\u2217)\u2016 \u2264 \u03c1L\u2016w1\u2212w2\u2016 By Taylor expansion, we have:\nL(w, \u03bb\u2217) \u2264L(w0, \u03bb\u2217) +\u2207wL(w0, \u03bb\u2217)T (w \u2212 w0)\n+ 1\n2 (w \u2212 w0)T\u22072wwL(w0, \u03bb\u2217)(w \u2212 w0) + \u03c1L 6 \u2016w \u2212 w0\u20163 (A.72)\nSince w,w0 are feasible, we know: L(w, \u03bb\u2217) = f(w) and L(w0, \u03bb\u2217) = f(w0), this gives:\nf(w) \u2264 f(w0) + \u03c7(w0)T (w \u2212 w0) + 1\n2 (w \u2212 w0)TM(w0)(w \u2212 w0) + \u03c1L 6 \u2016w \u2212 w0\u20163\n(A.73)\nDerivative of \u03c7(w) By taking derative of \u03c7(w) again, we know the change of this tangent gradient can be characterized by:\n\u2207\u03c7(w) = H\u2212 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bb\u2217i (w)\u22072ci(w)\u2212 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u2207ci(w)\u2207\u03bb\u2217i (w)T (A.74)\nDenote\nN(w) = \u2212 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u2207ci(w)\u2207\u03bb\u2217i (w)T (A.75)\n176\nWe immediately know that \u2207\u03c7(w) = M(w) +N(w).\nRemark. The additional term N(w) is not necessary to be even symmetric in general. This is due to the fact that \u03c7(w) may not be the gradient of any scalar function. However, N(w) has an important property that is: for any vector v \u2208 Rd, N(w)v \u2208 T c(w).\nFinally, for completeness, we state here the first/second-order necessary (or sufficient) conditions for optimality.

In equality constraint problem Eq.(A.63), suppose that for some feasible point w\u2020 \u2208 Rd, and there\u2019s Lagrange multiplier vector \u03bb\u2020 for which the KKT conditions are satisfied. Suppose also that:\nvT\u22072xxL(w\u2020, \u03bb\u2020)v > 0 for all v \u2208 T (w\u2020), v 6= 0 (A.79)\n177\nThen w\u2020 is a strict local solution.\nRemark. By definition Eq.(A.68), we know immediately \u03bb\u2217(w\u2020) is one of valid Lagrange multipliers \u03bb\u2020 for which the KKT conditions are satisfied.

First, since for any vector v\u0302 \u2208 T0, we have \u2016C(w0)T v\u0302\u2016 = 0, then by simple linear algebra, it\u2019s easy to show:\n\u2016C(w0)T (w \u2212 w0)\u20162 =\u2016C(w0)TPT c0 (w \u2212 w0)\u20162 \u2265 \u03c32min\u2016PT c0 (w \u2212 w0)\u20162\n\u2265\u03b12c\u2016PT c0 (w \u2212 w0)\u20162 (A.82)\nOn the other hand, by \u03b2i-smooth, we have:\n|ci(w)\u2212 ci(w0)\u2212\u2207ci(w0)T (w \u2212 w0)| \u2264 \u03b2i 2 \u2016w \u2212 w0\u20162 (A.83)\nSince w,w0 are feasible points, we have ci(w) = ci(w0) = 0, which gives:\n\u2016C(w0)T (w \u2212 w0)\u20162 = m\u2211\ni=1\n(\u2207ci(w0)T (w \u2212 w0))2 \u2264 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b22i 4 \u2016w \u2212 w0\u20164 (A.84)\nCombining Eq.(A.82) and Eq.(A.84), and the definition of R, we have:\n\u2016PT c0 (w \u2212 w0)\u20162 \u2264 1\n4R2 \u2016w \u2212 w0\u20164 =\n1\n4R2 (\u2016PT c0 (w \u2212 w0)\u20162 + \u2016PT0(w \u2212 w0)\u20162)2 (A.85)\nSolving this second-order inequality gives two solution\n\u2016PT c0 (w \u2212 w0)\u2016 \u2264 \u2016PT0(w \u2212 w0)\u20162\nR or \u2016PT c0 (w \u2212 w0)\u2016 \u2265 R (A.86)\nBy assumption, we know \u2016w \u2212 w0\u2016 < R (so the second case cannot be true), which finishes the proof.\nHere, we see the \u221a\u2211m\ni=1 \u03b22i \u03b12c = 1 R serves as a upper bound of the curvatures on the constraint\nmanifold, and equivalently, R serves as a lower bound of the radius of curvature. \u03b1c-RLICQ and smoothness guarantee that the curvature is bounded.\n179\nNext we show the normal/tangent space of nearby points are close.\nLemma A.7. Suppose the constraints {ci}mi=1 are \u03b2i-smooth, and \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all w \u2208 W. Let \u2211mi=1 \u03b22i \u03b12c = 1 R2 , for any w,w0 \u2208 W, let T0 = T (w0). Then for all v\u0302 \u2208 T (w) so that \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1, we have\n\u2016PT c0 \u00b7 v\u0302\u2016 \u2264 \u2016w \u2212 w0\u2016\nR (A.87)\nProof. With similar calculation as Eq.(A.82), we immediately have:\n\u2016PT c0 \u00b7 v\u0302\u20162 \u2264 \u2016C(w0)T v\u0302\u20162 \u03c32min(C(w)) \u2264 \u2016C(w0) T v\u0302\u20162 \u03b12c (A.88)\nSince v\u0302 \u2208 T (w) , we have C(w)T v\u0302 = 0, combined with the fact that v\u0302 is a unit vector, we have:\n\u2016C(w0)T v\u0302\u20162 =\u2016[C(w0)\u2212 C(w)]T v\u0302\u20162 = m\u2211\ni=1\n([\u2207ci(w0)\u2212\u2207ci(w)]T v\u0302)2\n\u2264 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u2016\u2207ci(w0)\u2212\u2207ci(w)\u20162\u2016v\u0302\u20162 \u2264 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b22i \u2016w0 \u2212 w\u20162 (A.89)\nCombining Eq.(A.88) and Eq.(A.89), and the definition of R, we concludes the proof.\nLemma A.8. Suppose the constraints {ci}mi=1 are \u03b2i-smooth, and \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all w \u2208 W. Let \u2211mi=1 \u03b22i \u03b12c = 1 R2 , for any w,w0 \u2208 W, let T0 = T (w0). Then for all v\u0302 \u2208 T c(w) so that \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1, we have\n\u2016PT0 \u00b7 v\u0302\u2016 \u2264 \u2016w \u2212 w0\u2016\nR (A.90)\nProof. By definition of projection, clearly, we have PT0 \u00b7 v\u0302 + PT c0 \u00b7 v\u0302 = v\u0302. Since v\u0302 \u2208 T c(w), without loss of generality, assume v\u0302 = \u2211m i=1 \u03bbi\u2207ci(w). Define d\u0303 = \u2211m i=1 \u03bbi\u2207ci(w0), clearly\n180\nd\u0303 \u2208 T c0 . Since projection gives the closest point in subspace, we have:\n\u2016PT0 \u00b7 v\u0302\u2016 =\u2016PT c0 \u00b7 v\u0302 \u2212 v\u0302\u2016 \u2264 \u2016d\u0303\u2212 v\u0302\u2016\n\u2264 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi\u2016\u2207ci(w0)\u2212\u2207ci(w)\u2016 \u2264 m\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi\u03b2i\u2016w0 \u2212 w\u2016 (A.91)\nOn the other hand, let \u03bb = (\u03bb1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03bbm)T , we know C(w)\u03bb = v\u0302, thus:\n\u03bb = C(w)\u2020v\u0302 = (C(w)TC(w))\u22121C(w)T v\u0302 (A.92)\nTherefore, by \u03b1c-RLICQ and the fact v\u0302 is unit vector, we know: \u2016\u03bb\u2016 \u2264 1\u03b1c . Combined with Eq.(A.91), we finished the proof.\nUsing the previous lemmas, we can then prove that: starting from any point w0 on constraint manifold, the result of adding any small vector v and then projected back to feasible set, is not very different from the result of adding PT (w0)v.\nLemma A.9. Suppose the constraints {ci}mi=1 are \u03b2i-smooth, and \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all w \u2208 W. Let \u2211mi=1 \u03b22i \u03b12c = 1 R2 , for any w0 \u2208 W, let T0 = T (w0). Then let w1 = w0 + \u03b7v\u0302, and w2 = w0 + \u03b7PT0 \u00b7 v\u0302, where v\u0302 \u2208 Sd\u22121 is a unit vector. Then, we have:\n\u2016\u03a0W(w1)\u2212 w2\u2016 \u2264 4\u03b72\nR (A.93)\nWhere projection \u03a0W(w) is defined as the closet point to w on feasible set W.\nProof. First, note that \u2016w1 \u2212 w0\u2016 = \u03b7, and by definition of projection, there must exist a project \u03a0W(w) inside the ball B\u03b7(w1) = {w | \u2016w \u2212 w1\u2016 \u2264 \u03b7}.\n181\nDenote u1 = \u03a0W(w1), and clearly u1 \u2208 W. we can formulate u1 as the solution to following constrained optimization problems:\nmin u\n\u2016w1 \u2212 u\u20162 (A.94)\ns.t. ci(u) = 0, i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , m\nSince function f(u) = \u2016w1\u2212u\u20162 and ci(u) are continuously differentiable by assumption, and the condition \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all w \u2208 W implies that LICQ holds for u1. Therefore, by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker necessary conditions, we immediately know (w1 \u2212 u1) \u2208 T c(u1).\nSince u1 \u2208 B\u03b7(w1), we know \u2016w0 \u2212 u1\u2016 \u2264 2\u03b7, by Lemma A.8, we immediately have:\n\u2016PT0(w1 \u2212 u1)\u2016 = \u2016PT0(w1 \u2212 u1)\u2016\n\u2016w1 \u2212 u1\u2016 \u2016w1 \u2212 u1\u2016 \u2264\n1 R \u2016w0 \u2212 u1\u2016 \u00b7 \u2016w1 \u2212 u1\u2016 \u2264 2 R \u03b72 (A.95)\nLet v1 = w0 + PT0(u1 \u2212 w0), we have:\n\u2016v1 \u2212 w2\u2016 =\u2016(v1 \u2212 w0)\u2212 (w2 \u2212 w0)\u2016 = \u2016PT0(u1 \u2212 w0)\u2212 PT0(w1 \u2212 w0)\u2016\n=\u2016PT0(w1 \u2212 u1)\u2016 \u2264 2\nR \u03b72 (A.96)\nOn the other hand by Lemma A.6, we have:\n\u2016u1 \u2212 v1\u2016 = \u2016PT c0 (u1 \u2212 w0)\u2016 \u2264 1\n2R \u2016u1 \u2212 w0\u20162 \u2264\n2 R \u03b72 (A.97)\nCombining Eq.(A.96) and Eq.(A.97), we finished the proof.\n182"}, {"heading": "A.2.3 Main Theorem", "text": "Now we are ready to prove the main theorems. First we revise the definition of strict saddle in the constrained case.\nDefinition A.4. A twice differentiable function f(w) with constraints ci(w) is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)strict saddle, if for any point w one of the following is true\n1. \u2016\u03c7(w)\u2016 \u2265 \u01eb.\n2. v\u0302TM(w)v\u0302 \u2264 \u2212\u03b3 for some v\u0302 \u2208 T (w), \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1\n3.

Suppose the constraints {ci}mi=1 are \u03b2i-smooth, and \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all w \u2208 W. Furthermore, if function f is L-Lipschitz, and the noise \u03be is bounded, then running PSGD as in Eq.(A.64) is equivalent to running:\nwt = wt\u22121 \u2212 \u03b7 \u00b7 (\u03c7(wt\u22121) + PT (wt\u22121)\u03bet\u22121) + \u03b9t\u22121 (A.98)\nwhere \u03b9 is the correction for projection, and \u2016\u03b9\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b72).\nProof. Lemma A.10 is a direct corollary of Lemma A.9.\nThe intuition behind this lemma is that: when {ci}mi=1 are smooth and \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all w \u2208 W, then the constraint manifold has bounded curvature every where. Then, if we only care about first order behavior, it\u2019s well-approximated by the local dynamic in tangent plane, up to some second-order correction.\n183\nTherefore, by Eq.(A.98), we see locally it\u2019s not much different from the unconstrainted case Eq.(A.1) up to some negeligable correction. In the following analysis, we will always use formula Eq.(A.98) as the update equation for PSGD.\nSince most of following proof bears a lot similarity as in unconstrained case, we only pointed out the essential steps in our following proof.\nTheorem A.5 (Main Theorem for Equality-Constrained Case). Suppose a function f(w) : Rd \u2192 R with constraints ci(w) : Rd \u2192 R is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle, and has a stochastic gradient oracle with radius at most Q, also satisfying E\u03be = 0 and E\u03be\u03beT = \u03c32I. Further, suppose the function function f is B-bounded, L-Lipschitz, \u03b2-smooth, and has \u03c1-Lipschitz Hessian, and the constraints {ci}mi=1 is Li-Lipschitz, \u03b2i-smooth, and has \u03c1i-Lipschitz Hessian. Then there exists a threshold \u03b7max = \u0398\u0303(1), so that for any \u03b6 > 0, and for any \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b7max/max{1, log(1/\u03b6)}, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b6 in t = O\u0303(\u03b7\u22122 log(1/\u03b6)) iterations, PSGD outputs a point wt that is O\u0303( \u221a \u03b7 log(1/\u03b7\u03b6))-close to some local minimum w\u22c6.\nFirst, we proof the assumptions in main theorem implies the smoothness conditions for M(w), N(w) and \u22072wwL(w, \u03bb\u2217(w\u2032)).\nLemma A.11. Under the assumptions of Theorem A.5, there exists \u03b2M , \u03b2N , \u03c1M , \u03c1N , \u03c1L polynomial related to B,L, \u03b2, \u03c1, 1 \u03b1c and {Li, \u03b2i, \u03c1i}mi=1 so that:\n1. \u2016M(w)\u2016 \u2264 \u03b2M and \u2016N(w)\u2016 \u2264 \u03b2N for all w \u2208 W.\n2. M(w) is \u03c1M -Lipschitz, and N(w) is \u03c1N -Lipschitz, and \u22072wwL(w, \u03bb\u2217(w\u2032)) is \u03c1L-Lipschitz\nfor all w\u2032 \u2208 W.\nProof. By definition of M(w), N(w) and \u22072wwL(w, \u03bb\u2217(w\u2032)), the above conditions will holds if there exists B\u03bb, L\u03bb, \u03b2\u03bb bounded by O\u0303(1), so that \u03bb \u2217(w) is B\u03bb-bounded, L\u03bb-Lipschitz, and \u03b2\u03bb-smooth.\n184\nBy definition Eq.(A.68), we have:\n\u03bb\u2217(w) = C(w)\u2020\u2207f(w) = (C(w)TC(w))\u22121C(w)T\u2207f(w) (A.99)\nBecause f is B-bounded, L-Lipschitz, \u03b2-smooth, and its Hessian is \u03c1-Lipschitz, thus, eventually, we only need to prove that there exists Bc, Lc, \u03b2c bounded by O\u0303(1), so that the pseudo-inverse C(w)\u2020 is Bc-bounded, Lc-Lipschitz, and \u03b2c-smooth.\nSince \u03b1c-RLICQ holds for all feasible points, we immediately have: \u2016C(w)\u2020\u2016 \u2264 1\u03b1c , thus bounded. For simplicity, in the following context we use C\u2020 to represent C\u2020(w) without ambiguity. By some calculation of linear algebra, we have the derivative of pseudo-inverse:\n\u2202C(w)\u2020\n\u2202wi = \u2212C\u2020\u2202C(w) \u2202wi C\u2020 + C\u2020[C\u2020]T\n\u2202C(w)T\n\u2202wi (I \u2212 CC\u2020) (A.100)\nAgain, \u03b1c-RLICQ holds implies that derivative of pseudo-inverse is well-defined for every feasible point. Let tensor E(w), E\u0303(w) to be the derivative of C(w), C\u2020(w), which is defined as:\n[E(w)]ijk = \u2202[C(w)]ik\n\u2202wj [E\u0303(w)]ijk = \u2202[C(w)\u2020]ik \u2202wj\n(A.101)\nDefine the transpose of a 3rd order tensor ETi,j,k = Ek,j,i, then we have\nE\u0303(w) = \u2212[E(w)](C\u2020, I, C\u2020) + [E(w)T ](C\u2020[C\u2020]T , I, (I \u2212 CC\u2020)) (A.102)\nwhere by calculation [E(w)](I, I, ei) = \u22072ci(w).\nFinally, since C(w)\u2020 and \u22072ci(w) are bounded by O\u0303(1), by Eq.(A.102), we know E\u0303(w) is bounded, that is C(w)\u2020 is Lipschitz. Again, since both C(w)\u2020 and \u22072ci(w) are bounded, Lipschitz, by Eq.(A.102), we know E\u0303(w) is also O\u0303(1)-Lipschitz. This finishes the proof.\n185\nFrom now on, we can use the same proof strategy as unconstraint case. Below we list the corresponding lemmas and the essential steps that require modifications.\nLemma A.12.

If \u03b7max is chosen small enough, by Remark A.2.1 and Lemma A.6, we have in addition:\n\u03c7(wt) T (wt \u2212 w\u22c6)1Et = (wt \u2212 w\u22c6)T\n\u222b 1\n0\n(M+N)(w\u22c6 + t(wt \u2212 w\u22c6))dt \u00b7 (wt \u2212 w\u22c6)1Et\n\u2265 [\u03b1\u2016wt \u2212 w\u22c6\u20162 \u2212 O\u0303(\u2016wt \u2212 w\u22c6\u20163)]1Et \u2265 0.5\u03b1\u2016wt \u2212 w\u22c6\u201621Et (A.107)\nThen, everything else follows almost the same as the proof of Lemma A.2.\nLemma A.13. Under the assumptions of Theorem A.5, with notations in Lemma A.11, for any initial point w0 where \u2016\u03c7(w0)\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b7) < \u01eb, and v\u0302TM(w0)v\u0302 \u2264 \u2212\u03b3 for some v\u0302 \u2208 T (w), \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1, then there is a number of steps T that depends on w0 such that:\nEf(wT )\u2212 f(w0) \u2264 \u2212\u2126\u0303(\u03b7) (A.108)\nThe number of steps T has a fixed upper bound Tmax that is independent of w0 where T \u2264 Tmax = O((log(d\u2212m))/\u03b3\u03b7).\nSimilar to the unconstrained case, we show this by a coupling sequence. Here the sequence we construct will only walk on the tangent space, by Lemmas in previous subsection, we\n187\nknow this is not very far from the actual sequence. We first define and characterize the coupled sequence in the following lemma:\nLemma A.14. Under the assumptions of Theorem A.5, with notations in Lemma A.11.

For simplicity, denote \u03c7\u0303(w) = \u2207f\u0303(w), and M\u0303 = P TT0M(w0)PT0, then we have analytically:\n\u03c7\u0303(w\u0303t) = (1\u2212 \u03b7M\u0303)t\u03c7\u0303(w\u03030)\u2212 \u03b7M\u0303 t\u22121\u2211\n\u03c4=0\n(1\u2212 \u03b7M\u0303)t\u2212\u03c4\u22121PT0\u03be\u03c4 (A.110)\nw\u0303t \u2212 w0 = \u2212\u03b7 t\u22121\u2211\n\u03c4=0\n(1\u2212 \u03b7M\u0303)\u03c4 \u03c7\u0303(w\u03030)\u2212 \u03b7 t\u22121\u2211\n\u03c4=0\n(1\u2212 \u03b7M\u0303)t\u2212\u03c4\u22121PT0\u03be\u03c4 (A.111)\nFurther, for any initial point w0 where \u2016\u03c7(w0)\u2016 \u2264 O\u0303(\u03b7) < \u01eb, and minv\u0302\u2208T (w),\u2016v\u0302\u2016=1 v\u0302TM(w0)v\u0302 = \u2212\u03b30.

Under the assumptions of Theorem A.5, with notations in Lemma A.11. Let {wt} be the corresponding sequence generated by running PSGD on function f . Also let f\u0303 and {w\u0303t} be defined as in Lemma A.14.

We first do a change of\ncoordinates to work in the coordinate system specified by (ai)\u2019s (this does not change the dynamics of the algorithm). In particular, let u = \u2211d\ni=1 xiai (where x \u2208 Rd), then we can see\nT (u, u, u, u) = \u2211d\ni=1 x 4 i . Therefore let f(x) = \u2212\u2016x\u201644, the optimization problem is equivalent\nto\nmin f(x) (A.141)\ns.t. \u2016x\u201622 = 1\nThis is a constrained optimization, so we apply the framework developed in Section 2.2.3.\n195\nLet c(x) = \u2016x\u201622 \u2212 1. We first compute the Lagrangian\nL(x, \u03bb) = f(x)\u2212 \u03bbc(x) = \u2212\u2016x\u201644 \u2212 \u03bb(\u2016x\u201622 \u2212 1). (A.142)\nSince there is only one constraint, and the gradient when \u2016x\u2016 = 1 always have norm 2, we know the set of constraints satisfy 2-RLICQ. In particular, we can compute the correct value of Lagrangian multiplier \u03bb,\n\u03bb\u2217(x) = argmin \u03bb \u2016\u2207xL(x, \u03bb)\u2016 = argmin \u03bb\nd\u2211\ni=1\n(2x3i + \u03bbxi) 2 = \u22122\u2016x\u201644 (A.143)\nTherefore, the gradient in the tangent space is equal to\n\u03c7(x) = \u2207xL(x, \u03bb)|(x,\u03bb\u2217(x)) = \u2207f(x)\u2212 \u03bb\u2217(x)\u2207c(x)\n= \u22124(x31, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x3d)T \u2212 2\u03bb\u2217(x)(x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd)T = 4 ( (x21 \u2212 \u2016x\u201644)x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (x2d \u2212 \u2016x\u201644)xd ) (A.144)\nThe second-order partial derivative of Lagrangian is equal to\nM(x) = \u22072xxL(x, \u03bb)|(x,\u03bb\u2217(x)) = \u22072f(x)\u2212 \u03bb\u2217(x)\u22072c(x)\n= \u221212diag(x21, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x2d)\u2212 2\u03bb\u2217(x)Id = \u221212diag(x21, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x2d) + 4\u2016x\u201644Id (A.145)\n196\nSince the variable x has bounded norm, and the function is a polynomial, it\u2019s clear that the function itself is bounded and all its derivatives are bounded. Moreover, all the derivatives of the constraint are bounded. We summarize this in the following lemma.\nLemma A.16. The objective function (2.9) is bounded by 1, its p-th order derivative is bounded by O( \u221a d) for p = 1, 2, 3. The constraint\u2019s p-th order derivative is bounded by 2, for p = 1, 2, 3.\nTherefore the function satisfy all the smoothness condition we need. Finally we show the gradient and Hessian of Lagrangian satisfy the (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle property. Note that we did not try to optimize the dependency with respect to d.\nTheorem A.7. The only local minima of optimization problem (2.9) are \u00b1ai (i \u2208 [d]). Further it satisfy (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle for \u03b3 = 7/d, \u03b1 = 3 and \u01eb, \u03b4 = 1/poly(d).\nIn order to prove this theorem, we consider the transformed version Eq.A.141. We first need following two lemma for points around saddle point and local minimum respectively. We choose\n\u01eb0 = (10d) \u22124, \u01eb = 4\u01eb20, \u03b4 = 2d\u01eb0, S(x) = {i | |xi| > \u01eb0} (A.146)\nWhere by intuition, S(x) is the set of coordinates whose value is relative large.\nLemma A.17. Under the choice of parameters in Eq.(A.146), suppose \u2016\u03c7(x)\u2016 \u2264 \u01eb, and |S(x)| \u2265 2. Then, there exists v\u0302 \u2208 T (x) and \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1, so that v\u0302TM(x)v\u0302 \u2264 \u22127/d.\nProof. Suppose |S(x)| = p, and 2 \u2264 p \u2264 d. Since \u2016\u03c7(x)\u2016 \u2264 \u01eb = 4\u01eb20, by Eq.(A.144), we have for each i \u2208 [d], |[\u03c7(x)]i| = 4|(x2i \u2212 \u2016x\u201644)xi| \u2264 4\u01eb20. Therefore, we have:\n\u2200i \u2208 S(x), |x2i \u2212 \u2016x\u201644| \u2264 \u01eb0 (A.147)\n197\nand thus:\n|\u2016x\u201644 \u2212 1\np | = |\u2016x\u201644 \u2212\n1 p\n\u2211\ni\nx2i |\n\u2264|\u2016x\u201644 \u2212 1\np\n\u2211\ni\u2208S(x) x2i |+ |\n1 p\n\u2211\ni\u2208[d]\u2212S(x) x2i | \u2264 \u01eb0 +\nd\u2212 p p \u01eb20 \u2264 2\u01eb0 (A.148)\nCombined with Eq.A.147, this means:\n\u2200i \u2208 S(x), |x2i \u2212 1\np | \u2264 3\u01eb0 (A.149)\nBecause of symmetry, WLOG we assume S(x) = {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p}. Since |S(x)| \u2265 2, we can pick v\u0302 = (a, b, 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0). Here a > 0, b < 0, and a2 + b2 = 1. We pick a such that ax1 + bx2 = 0. The solution is the intersection of a radius 1 circle and a line which passes (0, 0), which always exists. For this v\u0302, we know \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1, and v\u0302Tx = 0 thus v\u0302 \u2208 T (x). We have:\nv\u0302TM(x)v\u0302 = \u2212(12x21 + 4\u2016x\u201644)a2 \u2212 (12x22 + 4\u2016x\u201644)b2\n=\u2212 8x21a2 \u2212 8x22b2 \u2212 4(x21 \u2212 \u2016x\u201644))a2 \u2212 4(x22 \u2212 \u2016x\u201644))b2 \u2264\u2212 8 p + 24\u01eb0 + 4\u01eb0 \u2264 \u22127/d (A.150)\nWhich finishes the proof.\nLemma A.18. Under the choice of parameters in Eq.(A.146), suppose \u2016\u03c7(x)\u2016 \u2264 \u01eb, and |S(x)| = 1. Then, there is a local minimum x\u22c6 such that \u2016x\u2212 x\u22c6\u2016 \u2264 \u03b4, and for all x\u2032 in the 2\u03b4 neighborhood of x\u22c6, we have v\u0302TM(x\u2032)v\u0302 \u2265 3 for all v\u0302 \u2208 T (x\u2032), \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1\nProof. WLOG, we assume S(x) = {1}. Then, we immediately have for all i > 1, |xi| \u2264 \u01eb0, and thus:\n1 \u2265 x21 = 1\u2212 \u2211\ni>1\nx2i \u2265 1\u2212 d\u01eb20 (A.151)\n198\nTherefore x1 \u2265 \u221a 1\u2212 d\u01eb20 or x1 \u2264 \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 d\u01eb20. Which means x1 is either close to 1 or close to \u22121. By symmetry, we know WLOG, we can assume the case x1 \u2265 \u221a 1\u2212 d\u01eb20. Let e1 = (1, 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0), then we know:\n\u2016x\u2212 e1\u20162 \u2264 (x1 \u2212 1)2 + \u2211\ni>1\nx2i \u2264 2d\u01eb20 \u2264 \u03b42 (A.152)\nNext, we show e1 is a local minimum. According to Eq.A.145, we know M(e1) is a diagonal matrix with 4 on the diagonals except for the first diagonal entry (which is equal to \u22128), since T (e1) = span{e2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ed}, we have:\nvTM(e1)v \u2265 4\u2016v\u20162 > 0 for all v \u2208 T (e1), v 6= 0 (A.153)\nWhich by Theorem A.4 means e1 is a local minimum.\nFinally, denote T1 = T (e1) be the tangent space of constraint manifold at e1.

According to Lemma A.17 and Lemma A.18, we immediately know the optimization problem satisfies (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle.\nThe only thing remains to show is that the only local minima of optimization problem (2.9) are \u00b1ai (i \u2208 [d]). Which is equivalent to show that the only local minima of the transformed problem is \u00b1ei (i \u2208 [d]), where ei = (0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0, 1, 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0), where 1 is on i-th coordinate.\nBy investigating the proof of Lemma A.17 and Lemma A.18, we know these two lemmas actually hold for any small enough choice of \u01eb0 satisfying \u01eb0 \u2264 (10d)\u22124, by pushing \u01eb0 \u2192 0, we know for any point satisfying |\u03c7(x)| \u2264 \u01eb \u2192 0, if it is close to some local minimum, it must satisfy 1 = |S(x)| \u2192 supp(x). Therefore, we know the only possible local minima are \u00b1ei (i \u2208 [d]). In Lemma A.18, we proved e1 is local minimum, by symmetry, we finishes the proof."}, {"heading": "A.3.2 New Formulation", "text": "In this section we consider our new formulation (2.11). We first restate the optimization problem here:\nmin \u2211\ni 6=j T (u(i), u(i), u(j), u(j)), (A.156)\n\u2200i \u2016u(i)\u20162 = 1.\nNote that we changed the notation for the variables from ui to u (i), because in later proofs we will often refer to the particular coordinates of these vectors.\n200\nSimilar to the previous section, we perform a change of basis. The effect is equivalent to making ai\u2019s equal to basis vectors ei (and hence the tensor is equal to T = \u2211d i=1 e \u22974 i . After the transformation the equations become\nmin \u2211\n(i,j):i 6=j h(u(i), u(j)) (A.157)\ns.t. \u2016u(i)\u20162 = 1 \u2200i \u2208 [d]\nHere h(u(i), u(j)) = \u2211d\nk=1(u (i) k u (j) k ) 2, (i, j) \u2208 [d]2. We divided the objective function by 2 to\nsimplify the calculation.\nLet U \u2208 Rd2 be the concatenation of {u(i)} such that Uij = u(i)j . Let ci(U) = \u2016u(i)\u20162 \u2212 1 and f(U) = 1 2 \u2211 (i,j):i 6=j h(u (i), u(j)). We can then compute the Lagrangian\nL(U, \u03bb) = f(U)\u2212 d\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbici(U) = 1\n2\n\u2211\n(i,j):i 6=j h(u(i), u(j))\u2212\nd\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bbi(\u2016u(i)\u20162 \u2212 1) (A.158)\nThe gradients of ci(U)\u2019s are equal to (0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0, 2u(i), 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0)T , all of these vectors are orthogonal to each other (because they have disjoint supports) and have norm 2. Therefore the set of constraints satisfy 2-RLICQ. We can then compute the Lagrangian multipiers \u03bb\u2217 as follows\n\u03bb\u2217(U) = argmin \u03bb \u2016\u2207UL(U, \u03bb)\u2016 = argmin \u03bb\n4 \u2211\ni\n\u2211\nk\n( \u2211\nj:j 6=i U2jkUik \u2212 \u03bbiUik)2 (A.159)\nwhich gives:\n\u03bb\u2217i (U) = argmin \u03bb\n\u2211\nk\n( \u2211\nj:j 6=i U2jkUik \u2212 \u03bbiUik)2 =\n\u2211 j:j 6=i h(u(j), u(i)) (A.160)\n201\nTherefore, gradient in the tangent space is equal to\n\u03c7(U) = \u2207UL(U, \u03bb)|(U,\u03bb\u2217(U)) = \u2207f(U)\u2212 n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bb\u2217i (U)\u2207ci(U). (A.161)\nThe gradient is a d2 dimensional vector (which can be viewed as a d\u00d7d matrix corresponding to entries of U), and we express this in a coordinate-by-coordinate way. For simplicity of later proof, denote:\n\u03c8ik(U) = \u2211\nj:j 6=i [U2jk \u2212 h(u(j), u(i))] =\n\u2211 j:j 6=i [U2jk \u2212 d\u2211 l=1 U2ilU 2 jl] (A.162)\nThen we have:\n[\u03c7(U)]ik = 2( \u2211\nj:j 6=i U2jk \u2212 \u03bb\u2217i (U))Uik\n= 2Uik \u2211\nj:j 6=i (U2jk \u2212 h(u(j), u(i)))\n= 2Uik\u03c8ik(U) (A.163)\nSimilarly we can compute the second-order partial derivative of Lagrangian as\nM(U) = \u22072f(U)\u2212 d\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bb\u2217i\u22072ci(U). (A.164)\n202\nThe Hessian is a d2 \u00d7 d2 matrix, we index it by 4 indices in [d]. The entries are summarized below:\n[M(U)]ik,i\u2032k\u2032 = \u2202\n\u2202Ui\u2032k\u2032 [\u2207UL(U, \u03bb)]ik \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (U,\u03bb\u2217(U)) = \u2202 \u2202Ui\u2032k\u2032 [2( \u2211 j:j 6=i U2jk \u2212 \u03bb)Uik] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (U,\u03bb\u2217(U))\n=    2( \u2211 j:j 6=iU 2 jk \u2212 \u03bb\u2217i (U)) if k = k\u2032, i = i\u2032 4Ui\u2032kUik if k = k \u2032, i 6= i\u2032\n0 if k 6= k\u2032\n=    2\u03c8ik(U) if k = k \u2032, i = i\u2032 4Ui\u2032kUik if k = k \u2032, i 6= i\u2032 0 if k 6= k\u2032\n(A.165)\nSimilar to the previous case, it is easy to bound the function value and derivatives of the function and the constraints.\nLemma A.19. The objective function (2.11) and p-th order derivative are all bounded by poly(d) for p = 1, 2, 3. Each constraint\u2019s p-th order derivative is bounded by 2, for p = 1, 2, 3.\nTherefore the function satisfy all the smoothness condition we need. Finally we show the gradient and Hessian of Lagrangian satisfy the (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle property. Again we did not try to optimize the dependency with respect to d.\nTheorem A.8. Optimization problem (2.11) has exactly 2d \u00b7 d! local minimum that corresponds to permutation and sign flips of ai\u2019s. Further, it satisfy (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4)-strict saddle for \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b3, \u01eb, \u03b4 = 1/poly(d).\nAgain, in order to prove this theorem, we follow the same strategy: we consider the transformed version Eq.A.157. and first prove the following lemmas for points around saddle\n203\npoint and local minimum respectively. We choose\n\u01eb0 = (10d) \u22126, \u01eb = 2\u01eb60, \u03b4 = 2d\u01eb0, \u03b3 = \u01eb 4 0/4, S(u) = {k | |uk| > \u01eb0} (A.166)\nWhere by intuition, S(u) is the set of coordinates whose value is relative large.\nLemma A.20. Under the choice of parameters in Eq.(A.166), suppose \u2016\u03c7(U)\u2016 \u2264 \u01eb, and there exists (i, j) \u2208 [d]2 so that S(u(i)) \u2229 S(u(j)) 6= \u2205. Then, there exists v\u0302 \u2208 T (U) and \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1, so that v\u0302TM(U)v\u0302 \u2264 \u2212\u03b3.\nProof. Again, since \u2016\u03c7(x)\u2016 \u2264 \u01eb = 2\u01eb60, by Eq.(A.163), we have for each i \u2208 [d], |[\u03c7(x)]ik| = 2|Uik\u03c8ik(U)| \u2264 2\u01eb60. Therefore, have:\n\u2200k \u2208 S(u(i)), |\u03c8ik(U)| \u2264 \u01eb50 (A.167)\nThen, we prove this lemma by dividing it into three cases. Note in order to prove that there exists v\u0302 \u2208 T (U) and \u2016v\u0302\u2016 = 1, so that v\u0302TM(U)v\u0302 \u2264 \u2212\u03b3; it suffices to find a vector v \u2208 T (U) and \u2016v\u2016 \u2264 1, so that vTM(U)v \u2264 \u2212\u03b3.\nCase 1 : |S(u(i))| \u2265 2, |S(u(j))| \u2265 2, and |S(u(i)) \u2229S(u(j))| \u2265 2.\n204\nWLOG, assume {1, 2} \u2208 S(u(i)) \u2229S(u(j)), choose v to be vi1 = Ui24 , vi2 = \u2212Ui14 , vj1 = Uj2 4 and vj2 = \u2212Uj14 .

This can be easily proved by the same argument as in the proof of Theorem A.7."}, {"heading": "A.3.3 Extending to Tensors of Different Order", "text": "In this section we show how to generalize our algorithm to tensors of different orders. As a 8th order tensor (and more generally, 4pth order tensor for p \u2208 N+) can always be considered\n209\nto be a 4th order tensor with components a\u2297i ai ( a \u2297p i in general), so it is trivial to generalize our algorithm to 8th order or any 4pth order.\nFor tensors of other orders, we need to apply some transformation. As a concrete example, we show how to transform an orthogonal 3rd order tensor into an orthogonal 4th order tensor.\nWe first need to define a few notations. For third order tensors A,B \u2208 Rd3 , we define (A \u2297 B)i1,i2,...,i6 = Ai1,i2,i3Bi4,i5,i6(i1, ..., i6 \u2208 [d]). We also define the partial trace operation that maps a 6-th order tensor T \u2208 Rd6 to a 4-th order tensor in Rd4 :\nptrace(T )i1,i2,i3,i4 = d\u2211\ni=1\nT (i, i1, i2, i, i3, i4).\nBasically, the operation views the tensor as a d3\u00d7d3 matrix with d2\u00d7d2 d\u00d7d matrix blocks, then takes the trace of each matrix block. Now given a random variable X \u2208 Rd3 whose expectation is an orthogonal third order tensor, we can use these operations to construct an orthogonal 4-th order tensor:\nLemma A.22. Suppose the expectation of random variable X \u2208 Rd3 is an orthogonal 3rd order tensor:\nE[X ] = d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22973i ,\nwhere ai\u2019s are orthonormal vectors. Let X \u2032 be an independent sample of X, then we know\nE[ptrace(X \u2297X \u2032)] = d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22974i .\nIn other words, we can construct random samples whose expectation is equal to a 4-th order orthogonal tensor.\n210\nProof. Since ptrace and \u2297 are all linear operations, by linearity of expectation we know\nE[ptrace(X \u2297X \u2032)] = ptrace(E[X ]\u2297 E[X \u2032]) = ptrace(( d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22973i )\u2297 ( d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22973i )).\nWe can then expand out the product:\n( d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22973i )\u2297 ( d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22973i ) = d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22976i + \u2211\ni 6=j a\u22973i \u2297 a\u22973j .\nFor the diagonal terms, we know ptrace(a\u2297i 6) = \u2016ai\u20162a\u2297i 4 = a\u2297i 4. For the i 6= j terms, we know ptrace(a\u22973i \u2297 a\u22973j ) = \u3008ai, aj\u3009 a\u2297i 2\u2297 a\u2297j 2 = 0 (since ai, aj are orthogonal). Therefore we must have\nptrace((\nd\u2211\ni=1\na\u22973i )\u2297 ( d\u2211\ni=1\na\u22973i )) =\nd\u2211\ni=1\nptrace(a\u22976i ) + \u2211\ni 6=j ptrace(a\u22973i \u2297 a\u22973j ) =\nd\u2211\ni=1\na\u22974i .\nThis gives the result.\nUsing similar operations we can easily convert all odd-order tensors into order 4p(p \u2208 N+). For tensors of order 4p+ 2(p \u2208 N+), we can simply apply the partial trace and get a tensor of order 4p with desirable properties. Therefore our results applies for all orders of tensors.\n211"}, {"heading": "Appendix B", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Appendix for Applying Online Tensor", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Methods for Learning Latent Variable", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Models", "text": ""}, {"heading": "B.1 Stochastic Updates", "text": "After obtaining the whitening matrix, we whiten the data G\u22a4x,A, G \u22a4 x,B and G \u22a4 x,C by linear operations to get ytA, y t B and y t C \u2208 Rk:\nytA := \u2329 G\u22a4x,A,W \u232a , ytB := \u2329 ZBG \u22a4 x,B,W \u232a , ytC := \u2329 ZCG \u22a4 x,C,W \u232a .\nwhere x \u2208 X and t denotes the index of the online data.\n212\nThe stochastic gradient descent algorithm is obtained by taking the derivative of the loss function \u2202L t(v) \u2202vi :\n\u2202Lt(v)\n\u2202vi =\u03b8\nk\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008vj , vi\u30092 vj \u2212 (\u03b10 + 1)(\u03b10 + 2)\n2\n\u2329 vi, y t A \u232a \u2329 vi, y t B \u232a ytC \u2212 \u03b120 \u2329 \u03c6ti, y\u0304A \u232a \u2329 \u03c6ti, y\u0304 t B \u232a y\u0304C\n+ \u03b10(\u03b10 + 1)\n2\n\u2329 \u03c6ti, y t A \u232a \u2329 \u03c6ti, y t B \u232a y\u0304C + \u03b10(\u03b10 + 1)\n2\n\u2329 \u03c6ti, y t A \u232a \u2329 \u03c6ti, y\u0304B \u232a yC\n+ \u03b10(\u03b10 + 1)\n2\n\u2329 \u03c6ti, y\u0304A \u232a \u2329 \u03c6ti, y t B \u232a yC\nfor i \u2208 [k], where ytA, ytB and ytC are the online whitened data points as discussed in the whitening step and \u03b8 is a constant factor that we can set.\nThe iterative updating equation for the stochastic gradient update is given by\n\u03c6t+1i \u2190 \u03c6ti \u2212 \u03b2t \u2202Lt\n\u2202vi \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c6ti\n(B.1)\nfor i \u2208 [k], where \u03b2t is the learning rate, \u03c6ti is the last iteration eigenvector and \u03c6ti is the updated eigenvector.

We then apply the stochastic gradient descent technique to decompose the third order moment."}, {"heading": "B.3 GPU Architecture", "text": "The algorithm we propose is very amenable to parallelization and is scalable which makes it suitable to implement on processors with multiple cores in it. Our method consists of simple linear algebraic operations, thus enabling us to utilize Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) routines such as BLAS I (vector operations), BLAS II (matrix-vector operations), BLAS III (matrix-matrix operations), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and iterative operations such as stochastic gradient descent for tensor decomposition that can easily take advantage of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware units present in the GPUs. As such, our method is amenable to parallelization and is ideal for GPU-based implementation.\nOverview of code design: From a higher level point of view, a typical GPU based computation is a three step process involving data transfer from CPU memory to GPU global memory, operations on the data now present in GPU memory and finally, the result transfer from the GPU memory back to the CPU memory. We use the CULA library for implementing the linear algebraic operations.\nGPU compute architecture: The GPUs achieve massive parallelism by having hundreds of homogeneous processing cores integrated on-chip. Massive replication of these cores provides the parallelism needed by the applications that run on the GPUs. These cores, for the Nvidia GPUs, are known as CUDA cores, where each core has fully pipelined floating-point and integer arithmetic logic units. In Nvidia\u2019s Kepler architecture based GPUs, these CUDA cores are bunched together to form a Streaming Multiprocessor (SMX). These SMX units\n215\nact as the basic building block for Nvidia Kepler GPUs. Each GPU contains multiple SMX units where each SMX unit has 192 single-precision CUDA cores, 64 double-precision units, 32 special function units, and 32 load/store units for data movement between cores and memory.\nEach SMX has L1, shared memory and a read-only data cache that are common to all the CUDA cores in that SMX unit. Moreover, the programmer can choose between different configurations of the shared memory and L1 cache. Kepler GPUs also have an L2 cache memory of about 1.5MB that is common to all the on-chip SMXs. Apart from the above mentioned memories, Kepler based GPU cards come with a large DRAM memory, also known as the global memory, whose size is usually in gigabytes. This global memory is also visible to all the cores. The GPU cards usually do not exist as standalone devices. Rather they are part of a CPU based system, where the CPU and GPU interact with each other via PCI (or PCI Express) bus.\nIn order to program these massively parallel GPUs, Nvidia provides a framework known as CUDA that enables the developers to write programs in languages like C, C++, and Fortran etc. A CUDA program constitutes of functions called CUDA kernels that execute across many parallel software threads, where each thread runs on a CUDA core. Thus the GPU\u2019s performance and scalability is exploited by the simple partitioning of the algorithm into fixed sized blocks of parallel threads that run on hundreds of CUDA cores. The threads running on an SMX can synchronize and cooperate with each other via the shared memory of that SMX unit and can access the Global memory. Note that the CUDA kernels are launched by the CPU but they get executed on the GPU. Thus compute architecture of the GPU requires CPU to initiate the CUDA kernels.\nCUDA enables the programming of Nvidia GPUs by exposing low level API. Apart from CUDA framework, Nvidia provides a wide variety of other tools and also supports third party libraries that can be used to program Nvidia GPUs. Since a major chunk of the\n216\nscientific computing algorithms is linear algebra based, it is not surprising that the standard linear algebraic solver libraries like BLAS and Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) also have their equivalents for Nvidia GPUs in one form or another. Unlike CUDA APIs, such libraries expose APIs at a much higher-level and mask the architectural details of the underlying GPU hardware to some extent thus enabling relatively faster development time.\nConsidering the tradeoffs between the algorithm\u2019s computational requirements, design flexibility, execution speed and development time, we choose CULA-Dense as our main implementation library. CULA-Dense provides GPU based implementations of the LAPACK and BLAS libraries for dense linear algebra and contains routines for systems solvers, singular value decompositions, and eigen-problems. Along with the rich set of functions that it offers, CULA provides the flexibility needed by the programmer to rapidly implement the algorithm while maintaining the performance. It hides most of the GPU architecture dependent programming details thus making it possible for rapid prototyping of GPU intensive routines.\nThe data transfers between the CPU memory and the GPU memory are usually explicitly initiated by CPU and are carried out via the PCI (or PCI Express) bus interconnecting the CPU and the GPU. The movement of data buffers between CPU and GPU is the most taxing in terms of time. The buffer transaction time is shown in the plot in Figure B.1. Newer GPUs, like Kepler based GPUs, also support useful features like GPU-GPU direct data transfers without CPU intervention.\n217\nCULA exposes two important interfaces for GPU programming namely, standard and device. Using the standard interface, the developer can program without worrying about the underlying architectural details of the GPU as the standard interface takes care of all the data movements, memory allocations in the GPU and synchronization issues. This however comes at a cost. For every standard interface function call the data is moved in and out of the GPU even if the output result of one operation is directly required by the subsequent operation. This unnecessary movement of intermediate data can dramatically impact the performance of the program. In order to avoid this, CULA provides the device interface. We use the device interface for STGD in which the programmer is responsible for data buffer allocations in the GPU memory, the required data movements between the CPU and GPU, and operates only on the data in the GPU. Thus the subroutines of the program that are iterative in nature are good candidates for device implementation.\nPre-processing and post-processing: The pre-processing involves matrices whose leading dimension is of the order of number of nodes. These are implemented using the CULA standard interface BLAS II and BLAS III routines.\nPre-processing requires SVD computations for the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse calculations. We use CULA SVD routines since these SVD operations are carried out on matrices of\n218\nmoderate size. We further replaced the CULA SVD routines with more scalable SVD and pseudo inverse routines using random projections [66] to handle larger datasets such as DBLP dataset in our experiment.\nAfter STGD, the community membership matrix estimates are obtained using BLAS III routines provided by the CULA standard interface. The matrices are then used for hypothesis testing to evaluate the algorithm against the ground truth."}, {"heading": "B.4 Results on Synthetic Datasets", "text": "Homophily is an important factor in social interactions [119]; the term homophily refers to the tendency that actors in the same community interact more than across different communities. Therefore, we assume diagonal dominated community connectivity matrix P with diagonal elements equal to 0.9 and off-diagonal elements equal to 0.1. Note that P need neither be stochastic nor symmetric. Our algorithm allows for randomly generated community connectivity matrix P with support [0, 1]. In this way, we look at general directed social ties among communities.\nWe perform experiments for both the stochastic block model (\u03b10 = 0) and the mixed membership model. For the mixed membership model, we set the concentration parameter \u03b10 = 1.\n219\nWe note that the error is around 8%\u221214% and the running times are under a minute, when n \u2264 10000 and n \u226b k.\nThe results are given in Table B.1. We observe that more samples result in a more accurate recovery of memberships which matches intuition and theory. Overall, our learning algorithm performs better in the stochastic block model case than in the mixed membership model case although we note that the accuracy is quite high for practical purposes. Theoretically, this is expected since smaller concentration parameter \u03b10 is easier for our algorithm to learn [8]. Also, our algorithm is scalable to an order of magnitude more in n as illustrated by experiments on real-world large-scale datasets."}, {"heading": "B.5 Comparison of Error Scores", "text": "Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score [113] is another popular score which is defined differently for overlapping and non-overlapping community models. For non-overlapping block model, ground truth membership for node i is a discrete k-state categorical variable \u03a0block \u2208 [k] and the estimated membership is a discrete k\u0302-state categorical variable \u03a0\u0302block \u2208 [k\u0302]. The empirical distribution of ground truth membership categorical variable \u03a0block is easy to obtain. Similarly is the empirical distribution of the estimated membership categorical variable \u03a0\u0302block. NMI for block model is defined as\nNblock(\u03a0\u0302block : \u03a0block) := H(\u03a0block) +H(\u03a0\u0302block)\u2212H(\u03a0block, \u03a0\u0302block)(\nH(\u03a0block) +H(\u03a0\u0302block) ) /2\n.\nThe NMI for overlapping communities is a binary vector instead of a categorical variable [113]. The ground truth membership for node i is a binary vector of length k, \u03a0mix, while the estimated membership for node i is a binary vector of length k\u0302, \u03a0\u0302mix. This notion\n220\ncoincides with one column of our membership matrices \u03a0 \u2208 Rk\u00d7n and \u03a0\u0302 \u2208 Rk\u0302\u00d7n except that our membership matrices are stochastic. In other words, we consider all the nonzero entries of \u03a0 as 1\u2019s, then each column of our \u03a0 is a sample for \u03a0mix. The m-th entry of this binary vector is the realization of a random variable \u03a0mixm = (\u03a0mix)m, whose probability distribution is\nP (\u03a0mixm = 1) = nm n , P (\u03a0mixm = 0) = 1\u2212 nm n ,\nwhere nm is the number of nodes in community m. The same holds for \u03a0\u0302mixm . The normalized conditional entropy between \u03a0mix and \u03a0\u0302mix is defined as\nH(\u03a0\u0302mix|\u03a0mix)norm := 1\nk\n\u2211 j\u2208[k] min i\u2208[k\u0302]\nH ( \u03a0\u0302mixi|\u03a0mixj )\nH(\u03a0mixj ) (B.7)\nwhere \u03a0mixj denotes the j th entry of \u03a0mix and similarly for \u03a0\u0302mixi. The NMI for overlapping community is\nNmix(\u03a0\u0302mix : \u03a0mix) := 1\u2212 1\n2\n[ H(\u03a0mix|\u03a0\u0302mix)norm +H(\u03a0\u0302mix|\u03a0mix)norm ] .\nThere are two aspects in evaluating the error. The first aspect is the l1 norm error. According to Equation (B.7), the error function used in NMI score is H(\u03a0\u0302mixi |\u03a0mixj )\nH(\u03a0mixj ) . NMI is\nnot suitable for evaluating recovery of different sized communities. In the special case of a pair of extremely sparse and dense membership vectors, depicted in Figure B.2, H(\u03a0mixj ) is the same for both the dense and the sparse vectors since they are flipped versions of each other (0s flipped to 1s and vice versa). However, the smaller sized community (i.e. the sparser community vector), shown in red in Figure B.2, is significantly more difficult to recover than the larger sized community shown in blue in Figure B.2. Although this example is an extreme scenario that is not seen in practice, it justifies the drawbacks of the NMI.\n221\nThus, NMI is not suitable for evaluating recovery of different sized communities. In contrast,\nwhich is equal to P (\u03a0mix2 = 1) = # of 1s in \u03a02 n . Similarly, P (\u03a0mix1 = 1) = # of 1s in \u03a01 n which is equal to P (\u03a0mix2 = 0) = # of 0s in \u03a02 n . Therefore, H(\u03a0mix1) = H(\u03a0mix2).\nour error function employs a normalized l1 norm error which penalizes more for larger sized communities than smaller ones.\nThe second aspect is the error induced by false pairings of estimated and ground-truth communities. NMI score selects only the closest estimated community through normalized conditional entropy minimization and it does not account for statistically significant dependence between an estimated community and multiple ground truth communities and vice-versa, and therefore it underestimates error. However, our error score does not limit to a matching between the estimated and ground truth communities: if an estimated community is found to have statistically significant correlation with multiple ground truth communities (as evaluated by the p-value), we penalize for the error over all such ground truth communities. Thus, our error score is a harsher measure of evaluation than NMI. This notion of \u201csoft-matching\u201d between ground-truth and estimated communities also enables validation of recovery of a combinatorial union of communities instead of single ones.\n222\nA number of other scores such as \u201cseparability\u201d, \u201cdensity\u201d, \u201ccohesiveness\u201d and \u201cclustering coefficient\u201d [165] are non-statistical measures of faithful community recovery. The scores of [165] intrinsically aim to evaluate the level of clustering within a community. However our goal is to measure the accuracy of recovery of the communities and not how well-clustered the communities are.\nBanerjee and Langford [26] proposed an objective evaluation criterion for clustering which use classification performance as the evaluation measure. In contrast, we look at how well the method performs in recovering the hidden communities, and we are not evaluating predictive performance. Therefore, this measure is not used in our evaluation.\nFinally, we note that cophenetic correlation is another statistical score used for evaluating clustering methods, but note that it is only valid for hierarchical clustering and it is a measure of how faithfully a dendrogram preserves the pairwise distances between the original unmodeled data points [151]. Hence, it is not employed in this paper.\n223"}, {"heading": "Appendix C", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Appendix for Dictionary Learning via", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Convolutional Tensor Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "C.1 Cumulant Form", "text": "In [12], it is proved that in ICA model, the cumulant of observation x is decomposed into multi-linear transform of a diagonal cumulant of h.

We perform recursive grouping simultaneously on the sub-trees of the MST. Each of the sub-tree consists of an internal node and its neighborhood nodes. We keep track of the internal nodes of the MST, and their neighbors. The resultant latent sub-trees after LRG can be merged easily to recover the final latent tree. Consider a pair of neighboring sub-trees in the MST. They have two common nodes (the internal nodes) which are neighbors on MST. Firstly we identify the path from one internal node to the other in the trees to be merged, then compute the multivariate information distances between the internal nodes and the introduced hidden nodes. We recover the path between the two internal nodes in the merged tree by inserting the hidden nodes closely to their surrogate node. Secondly, we merge all the leaves which are not in this path by attaching them to their parent. Hence, the recursive grouping can be done in parallel and we can recover the latent tree structure via this merging method.\nLemma D.1. If an observable node vj is the surrogate node of a hidden node hi, then the hidden node hi can be discovered using vj and the neighbors of vj in the MST.\nThis is due to the additive property of the multivariate information distance on the tree and the definition of a surrogate node. This observation is crucial for a completely local and parallel structure and parameter estimation. It is also easy to see that all internal nodes in the MST are surrogate nodes.\nAfter the parallel construction of the MST, we look at all the internal nodes Xint. For vi \u2208 Xint, we denote the neighborhood of vi on MST as nbdsub(vi;MST) which is a small sub-tree. Note that the number of such sub-trees is equal to the number of internal nodes in MST.\n230\nFor any pair of sub-trees, nbdsub(vi;MST) and nbdsub(vj ;MST), there are two topological relationships, namely overlapping (i.e., when the sub-trees share at least one node in common) and non-overlapping (i.e., when the sub-trees do not share any nodes).\nSince we define a neighborhood centered at vi as only its immediate neighbors and itself on MST, the overlapping neighborhood pair nbdsub(vi;MST) and nbdsub(vj;MST) can only have conflicting paths, namely path(vi, vj;N i) and path(vi, vj ;N j), if vi and vj are neighbors in MST.\nWith this in mind, we locally estimate all the latent sub-trees, denoted as N i, by applying Recursive Grouping [41] in a parallel manner on nbdsub(vi;MST), \u2200vi \u2208 Xint. Note that the latent nodes automatically introduced by RG(vi) have vi as their surrogate. We update the tree structure by joining each level in a bottom-up manner. The testing of the relationship among nodes [41] uses the additive multivariate information distance metric (Appendix D.1) \u03a6(vi, vj; k) = dist(vi, vk)\u2212 dist(vi, vk) to decide whether the nodes vi and vj are parent-child or siblings. If they are siblings, they should be joined by a hidden parent. If they are parent and child, the child node is placed as a lower level node and we add the other node as the single parent node, which is then joined in the next level.\nFinally, for each internal edge of MST connecting two internal nodes vi and vj , we consider merging the latent sub-trees. In the example of two local estimated latent sub-trees in Figure 5.2, we illustrate the complete local merging algorithm that we propose."}, {"heading": "D.3 Proof Sketch for Theorem 5.1", "text": "We argue for the correctness of the method under exact moments. The sample complexity follows from the previous works. In order to clarify the proof ideas, we define the notion of surrogate node [41] as follows.\n231\nDefinition D.1. Surrogate node for hidden node hi on the latent tree T = (V, E) is defined as Sg(hi; T ) := arg min vj\u2208X dist(vi, vj).\nIn other words, the surrogate for a hidden node is an observable node which has the minimum multivariate information distance from the hidden node. See Figure 5.2(a), the surrogate node of h1, Sg(h1; T ), is v3, Sg(h2; T ) = Sg(h3; T ) = v5. Note that the notion of the surrogate node is only required for analysis, and our algorithm does not need to know this information.\nThe notion of surrogacy allows us to relate the constructed MST (over observed nodes) with the underlying latent tree. It can be easily shown that contracting the hidden nodes to their surrogates on latent tree leads to MST. Local recursive grouping procedure can be viewed as reversing these contractions, and hence, we obtain consistent local sub-trees.\nWe now argue the correctness of the structure union procedure, which merges the local subtrees. In each reconstructed sub-tree Ni, where vi is the group leader, the discovered hidden nodes {hi} form a surrogate relationship with vi, i.e. Sg(hi; T ) = vi. Our merging approach maintains these surrogate relationships. For example in Figure 5.2(d1,d2), we have the path v3\u2212h1\u2212v5 inN 3 and path v3\u2212h3\u2212h2\u2212v5 inN 5. The resulting path is v3\u2212h1\u2212h3\u2212h2\u2212v5, as seen in Figure 5.2(e). We now argue why this is correct. As discussed before, Sg(h1; T ) = v3 and Sg(h2; T ) = Sg(h3; T ) = v5. When we merge the two subtrees, we want to preserve the paths from the group leaders to the added hidden nodes, and this ensures that the surrogate relationships are preserved in the resulting merged tree. Thus, we obtain a global consistent tree structure by merging the local structures. The correctness of parameter learning comes from the consistency of the tensor decomposition techniques and careful alignments of the hidden labels across different decompositions.

For any sub-tree pairs nbd[vi;MST] and nbd[vi;MST], there is at most one overlapping edge. The overlapping edge exists if and only if vi \u2208 nbd(vj ;MST).\nThis is easy to see.\nLemma D.3. Denote the latent tree recovered from nbd[vi;MST] as N i and similarly for nbd[vj ;MST]. The inconsistency, if any, between N i and N j occurs in the overlapping path(vi, vj;N i) in and path(vi, vj;N j) after LRG implementation on each subtrees.\nWe now prove the correctness of LRG. Let us denote the latent tree resulting from merging a subset of small latent trees as TLRG(S), where S is the set of center of subtrees that are merged pair-wisely. CLRG algorithm in [41] implements the RG in a serial manner. Let us denote the latent tree learned at iteration i from CLRG is TCLRG(S), where S is the set of internal nodes visited by CLRG at current iteration . We prove the correctness of LRG by induction on the iterations.\nAt the initial step S = \u2205: TCLRG = MST and TLRG = MST , thus TCLRG = TLRG.\nNow we assume that for the same set Si\u22121, TCLRG = TLRG is true for r = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1. At iteration r = i where CLRG employs RG on the immediate neighborhood of node vi on TCLRG(Si\u22121), let us assume that Hi is the set of hidden nodes who are immediate neighbors of i\u2212 1. The CLRG algorithm thus considers all the neighbors and implements the RG. We know that the surrogate nodes of every latent node in Hi belong to previously visited nodes Si\u22121. According to Property D.1 and D.2, if we contract all the hidden node neighbors to their surrogate nodes, CLRG thus is a RG on neighborhood of i on MST.\nAs for our LRG algorithm at this step, TLRG(Si) is the merging between TLRG(Si\u22121)and N i. The latent nodes whose surrogate node is j are introduced between the edge (i\u2212 1, i). Now\n234\nthat we know N i is the RG output from immediate neighborhood of i on MST.

The traditional sparse coding introduces too many free parameters and is not suitable for compact morphological basis learning. We instead propose Gaussian prior convolutional sparse coding (GPCSC). The intuition for using convolution is due to the frequent replication of cells of similar shapes and the translation invariance property. Traditional sparse coding would learn both the shape of the cell and the location of the cell. But the convolutional sparse coding would only learn the shape here. We characterize cell spatial distribution via decoding the sparse activation map.\nTo formulate the problem formally: let I be the image observed, then the convolutional sparse coding model generates observed image I using filters (resembling cell shapes)F superposed\n240\nat locations indicated by the activation map M (whose sparsity pattern indicates cell spatial distribution and activation amplitude indicates gene expression profiles. )\nOur goals of segmenting cells, extracting cell basis, and estimating gene profiles and cell locations are reduced to this optimization learning problem:\nmin Fm,Mnm \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2211\nn\nIn \u2212 k\u2211\nm=1\nFm \u22c6 M n m \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2\nF\n+ \u2211\nn\n\u2211\nm\n\u03bb \u2016Mnm\u20160 ,\ns.t.

However, this approach causes inexact cell number estimation as filters with multi-modality (i.e., multiple cells) are learnt. We resolve this issue by proposing an Gaussian probability density function prior on the filters to guarantee single cell detection and achieve accurate cell number estimation. The support of M is also limited to the local maxima indicating cell centers.
