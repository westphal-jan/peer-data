In this report you ind an overview of relevant research ields and industrially applicable technologies for  building large scale cyber physical systems. A concept architecture is used to illustrate how existing pieces it  together and the maturity of the subsystems is estimated.  The goal is to structure the developments for Consumer and Industrial Internet technologists, cyber physical    systems researchers and people interested in the convergence of data & Internet of Things. It can be used for  planning developments of intelligent systems.
