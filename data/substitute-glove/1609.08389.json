Over a period of five days, a group of seventeen scholars, scientists, and students developed and compared algorithms for intertextual alignment and text classification, along with some basic language tools, including a stemmer and word segmenter.\nkeywords Tibetan; hackathon; stemming, segmentation, intertextual alignment, text classification\nINTRODUCTION\nIn February 2016, a group of four Tibetologists (from the University of Hamburg), one digital humanities scholar (from Europe), and twelve computer scientists (from Israel and Europe) got together in Kibbutz Lotan in the Arava region of Israel with the stated goal of developing algorithmic methods for advancing Tibetan Buddhist Textual Studies. Participants were either recruited by the organizers or responded to an announcement on several mailing lists. See Figure 1.\nThe six-hour drive down from Tel Aviv (including a stop to admire desert flora) afforded an opportunity for everyone to get to know each other. The back seats of the van were piled high with computer equipment and the kibbutz was to provide the necessary fast internet connection. The isolation of the kibbutz created an intense working environment and encouraged long hours; the stark natural beauty of the location contributed to a shared sense of tranquility of purpose.\nThe two main tasks that confronted the group that week (February 14-18) were (1) to develop algorithms for finding intertextual parallels that are only approximately the same, and (2) to experiment with algorithmic classification methods for identifying authorship and style. In both cases, the concern was centered on language issues specific to Tibetan.\nTibetan is a monosyllabic language belonging to the Tibeto-Burman branch of the SinoTibetan family. The language is ergative, with a plethora of (usually monosyllabic) grammatical particles, which are often omitted. Occasionally, the same syllable can be written using one of several orthographic variations, for example, sogs and stsogs. In the case of verbs, the syllable has various inflectional forms that are often homophones, a fact that can result in variants in the reading due to scribal errors or lack of standardization. An example of such inflectional forms is sgrub, bsgrubs, bsgrub, sgrubs (present, past, future and imperative,\n2 Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities http://jdmdh.episciences.org ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal\nrespectively), all of which are homophones. The intransitive form of the verb offers even more inflectional forms that yield homophones with their transitive counterpart, \u02bcgrub and grub (present/future and past, respectively).\nThe Tibetan Buddhist canon consists of two parts: the Kangyur (bKa\u02bc \u02bcgyur), which commonly comprises 108 volumes containing what is believed by tradition to be the Word of the Buddha, texts that were mostly translated directly from the Sanskrit original (with some from other languages and others indirectly via Chinese); and the Tengyur (bsTan \u02bcgyur), commonly comprising about 210 volumes consisting of canonical commentaries, treatises, and various kinds of manuals that were likewise mostly translated from Sanskrit (with some from other languages and a few originally written in Tibetan).\nAfter a quick lesson in Tibetan, the Buddhist canon, and modern Tibetan encoding conventions for the benefit of the less knowledgeable, the group split into four loose teams: (A) dataset preparation; (B) language tools; (C) intertextual alignment; and (D) text classification.. We describe each of these efforts in turn."}, {"heading": "I Hackathon tasks", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.1 Dataset Preparation", "text": "A prerequisite for the goals of the hackathon was data to work with: texts to compare and classify. We used Tibetan Buddhist texts obtained from various sources, and transcribed according to the Wylie convention [Wylie, 1959]. In this system, Tibetan is transliterated into Latin characters without diacritics; thus various Tibetan letters are represented by two or three Latin consonants. The texts had to be \u2015cleaned\u2016 by removing sigla and by standardizing punctuation. The texts included the Tibetan Buddhist canon in digital form (we used a modified form of the ACIP files of the Kangyur and Tengyur provided by Paul Hacket of Columbia University) and several sets of autochthonous Tibetan Buddhist texts of various authors (compiled by Eric Werner of Universit\u00e4t Hamburg). In addition, it was necessary to prepare test suites with manually prepared \u2015gold standard\u2016 answers, so that the performance of algorithms for finding parallel passages and for classifying texts could be measured. The passages were selected from various sources, particularly from (a) two doxographical texts (\u02bcgrub mtha\u02bc), the gZhung lugs rnam \u2019byed by Phywa pa Chos kni sengge (1109\u20131169; henceforth Phywa) and the \u02bcGrub mtha\u02bc mdzod by Klong chen pa Dri med \u02bcod zer (1308\u2013 1364; henceforth Klong), the latter including \u2015borrowed\u2016 passages from the former [Werner, 2014], and (b) Rong zom Chos kyi bzang po\u02bcs (11th c.) collected writings, which features numerous cases of parallel passages."}, {"heading": "1.2 Language Tools", "text": "Since syllables having the same stem may take many different forms, stemming is a crucial stage in almost every text-processing task one would like to perform in Tibetan. So, to support present and future analysis of Tibetan texts, developing a stemmer was one of the first orders of business.\nUsually, in Indo-European and Semitic languages, stemming is performed on the word level. However, in Tibetan, in which multisyllabic words are not separated by spaces or other marks, a syllable-based stemming mechanism is required even in order to segment the text\n3 Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities http://jdmdh.episciences.org ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal\ninto lexical items. Stemming is not the same as (grammatical) lemmatization, and the stemming process can result in a stem that is not a lexical entry in a dictionary. Moreover, unlike Indo-European languages, stemming of Tibetan is mostly relevant to verbs and verbal nouns (which are common in the language). Despite being inaccurate in some cases, stemming (for Tibetan, as for other languages) can improve tasks such as word segmentation and the detection of intertextual parallels [Klein et al., 2014]. Even for Tibetan words consisting of more than one syllable, stemming each \u2015substantial\u2016 syllable (i.e. excluding grammatical particles) makes sense since all the inflections are embedded at the syllable level. For instance, the words brtag dbyad (analysis) and brtags dpyad (analyzed) are stemmed to rtog dpyod (to analyze, analysis).\nThe stemmer works in the following manner: first, the syllable is divided into a sequence of Tibetan letters. This stage is required because the Wylie transliteration scheme represents some Tibetan letters by more than one character (e.g. zh, tsh). There is, fortunately, no ambiguity in the process of letter recognition. By design, the transliteration ensures that whenever a sequence of two or three characters represents a single letter, it cannot also be interpreted in context as a sequence of distinct Tibetan letters.\nFor the analysis of the Tibetan syllable we used an 8-tuple scheme: Each Tibetan syllable should contain one core letter and one vowel. Other positions (subscript, superscript, coda, prescript, postscript, and appended particle) are not obligatory. Each position contains a single letter, except for that of the appended particle, which can be any of six syllables. The \u2015stem\u2016 of a syllable is defined by us as consisting of the core letter or stacked letter (which, in turn, consists of the core letter and a superscript or a subscript, or both), the vowel (syllabic contractions contain two vowels at most), and the coda (if found). Syllables can be considered stemmically identical if these are consistent, despite additions or omissions of a prescript and/or a postscript. The final stage of the stemming is normalization, since there are groups of Tibetan letters that can be replaced one with another without changing the basic meaning of the syllable (in inflectional forms). Since the goal is to group all syllables that are ultimately stemmically identical into one and the same stem, we normalized all tuples according to an elaborate set of rules.\nThe stemmer, as described, extracts the information encoded in each Wylie transliterated syllable and makes it explicit. An important task, given two syllables, is to evaluate their stemmic similarity. Some substitutions can be considered silent or synonymous; others change the meaning completely; and there is a continuous spectrum in between. Metric learning algorithms were used to assess the relative importance of each substitution.\nAnother important language tool is word segmentation, that is, the grouping syllables into words. Since no spaces or special characters are used to mark word boundaries, the reader has to rely on language models to detect the word boundaries. The approach taken at the hackathon is based on a flavor of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) called \u2015long short-term memory\u2016 (LSTM) [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997]. LSTMs have been used in the past for word segmentation of Chinese text [Chen et al., 2015]. The tuple representation of syllables was used for this purpose.\nBoth stemmer and word segmentor have been made publicly available and can be accessed from http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachumd/Tools.html\n1.3 Intertextual Alignment\n4 Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities http://jdmdh.episciences.org ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal\nThe primary goal of the hackathon was to develop and compare tools for finding parallel passages between Tibetan texts that are the result of either acknowledged citations (with or without attributions) or borrowing (i.e. with no acknowledgement whatsoever). Generally, for determining the history of composition or relative chronology of a text, passages need not match precisely. That is, in addition to the fact that orthographical differences or omission/addition of grammatical particles are of no great significance, it is often the case that cited or borrowed passages are not necessarily reproduced verbatim, but are often slightly paraphrased or shortened, or both. For determining the identity of persons involved in the composition of the text and its transmission\u2014that is, the author, translator, scribe, or editor\u2014 the precision of the match is of greater significance, and even variation in orthography or omission/addition of grammatical particles may be relevant. In this regard, however, textual scholars must take into consideration that texts were often copied and edited and that through these processes changes could have been introduced into the text, either deliberately\u2014that is, particularly in terms of standardization of orthography and verb inflection, employment of particles, and even substitutions of terminology in cases of archaism\u2014or unintentionally.\nAccordingly, broadly speaking, there are two cases of interest: (a) an approximate alignment of what could be considered to be exactly the same text, that is, an alignment that allows variants that are considered accidental or non-substantial (that is, variations regarding omission/addition or different forms of the same grammatical particles, orthography, inflectional forms in the case of verbs, archaism vs. standardization, and the like), and (b) an approximate alignment of passages that contained the same text but in modified form of some sort, that is, an alignment that allows substantial variants in addition to the non-substantial ones (omission/addition of a substantial syllable, replacement of a substantial syllable by a completely different one, omission/addition of a string of syllables, occurrence of the same syllables in a different order, and the like). To address the problem of substantial variants that could occur also when a (more or less) exact citation or borrowing was intended, that is, such that have been intentionally introduced by either the author himself or by the scribes and editors during the process of transmission, or such that have been unintentionally crept in during the processes of composition and copying, a limited number of substantial variants must be admitted as well.\nThree algorithms competed during the hackathon on this task."}, {"heading": "1. One algorithm was TRACER [B\u00fcchler, 2013; B\u00fcchler et al., 2014], based on the \u2015bag of", "text": "words\u2016 method. TRACER is a general text reuse detection algorithm with a 7-level\narchitecture. Each step is configurable and can be optimized to specific text reuse tasks and corpora. The steps are preprocessing, featuring, selection, scoring and post-processing. This approach is called feature-based linking where only text reuse units with shared features are compared, as opposed to the comparison of the full text of passages, all against all. All passages are compared by comparing the words they contain, ignoring word order.\n2. Another method was based on Agents for Actors (AfA) [K\u00fcster, 2013], a \u2015digital humanities framework for distributed microservices for text analysis\u2016. AfA was originally developed\nfor the purpose of identifying allusions to Shakespearean passages in transcriptions of dialogues in films (hence \u2015actors\u2016 in its name). This algorithm compares passages both on the letter and the word level, and therefore catches variations at the orthographic and formulation levels, respectively. While its primary use is to identify references and allusions in texts, in the hackathon, the algorithm was tested to see how well it can also serve to identify parallel passages for very different types of texts in an unrelated language.\n5 Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities http://jdmdh.episciences.org ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal\n3. The third approach was based on an adaptation of the method of [Barsky et al., 2008], designed for matching DNA subsequences, to our problem [Klein et al., 2014]. This\nalgorithm looks for \u2015all against all approximate matches\u2016 (within some given threshold of difference between passages) by rephrasing the problem as finding maximal paths in a matching graph. That method was modified during the hackathon to work with syllable stems as the basic building block, rather than the individual character level used before. This change improved both run time and the quality of results. Since on the average a syllable has 4\u20135 characters, the speedup was two orders of magnitude. The quality of the results was also better because, with character-wise alignment syllables can share many letters but have no semantic similarity; see [Labenski et al., 2016; Labenski, 2016].\nAn infrastructure subteam, in addition to keeping everything up and running, parallelized the implementation of the third algorithm to run on a Sparc cluster of computers, located at Tel Aviv University. This is necessary for the ultimate goal, considering the large size of the corpus. The idea is simple: divide the texts into overlapping chunks; then run the original algorithm on all chunks in parallel; finally, piece all the results together.\nAll three algorithms were tested on a test set that was designed during the hackathon. Two documents (Phywa and Klong), known to contain many shared passages were chosen, and 24 pairs of parallel passages were annotated. See [Labenski, et al., in preparation].\nBy finding cited or borrowed passages within the corpora of Indo-Tibetan (i.e. translated) and Tibetan (i.e. autochthonous) Buddhist literature, several research questions can be better addressed:\n\u2022 determining the history of composition of individual texts;\n\u2022 determining relative chronology of groups of texts;\n\u2022 determining the intellectual scholarly milieu in which the texts emerged; and\n\u2022 determining the intellectual history behind the texts (viz. terminology and concepts).\nAfter identifying parallel passages, one can assess the frequencies of letter/syllable/word replacements in the aligned passages of selected texts or text groups. This can serve to help answer further research questions like: determining editorial policies and processes, such as standardization of orthography, standardization of employment of grammatical particles (i.e. according to the so-called sandhi rules); and identifying processes of \u2015revisions\u2016 of translated texts."}, {"heading": "1.4 Text Classification", "text": "The second major task that was addressed at the hackathon was the question of author profiling. While the question as to what extent the issue of authorship can be addressed in the case of translated texts is yet to be looked into, some general research questions related to authorship fall under the purview of machine classification. These include the following: (a) distinguishing between translated texts and autochthonous texts; (b) identifying the period in which a text was composed, Old Tibetan (7\u201311th c.), Classical Tibetan I (11\u201314th c.), or Classical Tibetan II (15-20th c.); (c) determining whether a translated canonical work belongs to the early period of translation (snga \u02bcgyur) or the new period (phyi \u02bcgyur); (d) in the case of autochthonous literature, differentiating between the so-called \u2015revealed\u2016 texts (texts that are\n6 Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities http://jdmdh.episciences.org ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal\nportrayed as having been transmitted supernaturally) vs. \u2015composed\u2016 texts; and (e) identifying an author\u2019s intellectual milieu (e.g. affiliation with a particular school of thought).\nA series of experiments were performed on scriptures and treatises, early and late, translated and autochthonous texts. We used a perceptron classifier with stochastic gradient descent. For our experiments on translations versus autochthonous, we used features similar to [Volansky et al., 2015], mainly: mean syllable length; mean sentence length; frequency of verbal prefixes and function words; frequency of foreign (Sanskrit) words; and type-to-token ratio. For authorship detection, we first used an automatic word segmenter and then used n-gram frequency and bag-of-words as features.\nBoth parts of the canon were employed as training data to determine features that are peculiar for the Kangyur, the corpus containing scriptures, on the one hand, and the Tengyur, the corpus containing treatises, commentaries, manuals and the like, on the other. Numerous autochthonous texts, including the entire collected writings of Rong zom Chos kyi bzang po, the entire collected writings of Sh\u0101kya mchog ldan (1428\u20131507), several works by Sa kya pa\u1e47\u1e0di ta Kun dga\u02bc rgyal mtshan (1182\u20131251), and several texts by Tsong kha pa Blo bzang grags pa (1357\u20131419), were tested against the translated canonical texts in order to determine features of translated versus autochthonous works. In addition, selected individual texts were tested. For example, Sa skya pa\u1e47di ta\u2019s Tshad ma rigs gter was compared with Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s (7th c.) Pram\u0101\u1e47avarttika in Tibetan translation, which enabled a comparison of autochthonous versus translated work on similar topics. The Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012bn\u0101masa\u1e45g\u012bti commentary ascribed to Rong zom pa (and at the same time included in the Tengyur as an Indian work in Tibetan translation) was compared with the canon in its entirety, as was the Tengyur alone with other works by Rong zom pa and additional autochthonous works, which provided a comparison of works whose origin has been considered doubtful with translated and autochthonous literature."}, {"heading": "II TABLES AND FIGURES", "text": "2.1 Figure\n7 Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities http://jdmdh.episciences.org ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal"}, {"heading": "IV REFERENCES AND CITATIONS", "text": "Conclusion The intense hackathon format proved to be quite exhilarating.
