In argumentation, knowledge is often (e.g. in [30]) represented via arguments and conflicts are captured via attacks among arguments, and reasoning amounts to selecting sets of collectively acceptable arguments, called extensions, where acceptability conditions are dependent on the semantics chosen (see e.g. [10, 7] for overviews of argumentation semantics).\nIt has been shown that argumentation is a perspicuous abstraction method capturing several existing reasoning paradigms, particularly non-monotonic reasoning and logic programming (see e.g. [30, 15, 38]), as well as forms of decision making (see e.g. [2]), to name a few. Consequently, argumentation can be seen as a significant approach to common-sense reasoning.\nArgumentation formalisms can be classified into two families, one that builds on Abstract Argumentation (AA) [30], and another commonly referred to as structured argumentation (see [13] for a recent overview). Whereas in AA arguments are atomic, structured argumentation formalisms usually specify the internal structure of arguments and/or attacks. Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) [15, 35, 33, 34, 58, 59, 23] is one particular structured argumentation formalism, where knowledge is represented through a deductive system comprising of a formal language and inference rules, uncertain information is represented via special sentences in the language, called assumptions, and attacks are constructively defined among sets of assumptions whenever one set of assumptions deduces (via rules) the contrary of some assumption in another set.\nIn this paper we deliver a new formalism, called ABA+, that extends ABA with preferences, because accounting for preferences is an important aspect of common-sense reasoning (see e.g. [27, 18, 41, 48] for discussions). Indeed, preferences are everyday phenomena helping, for example, to qualify the uncertainty of information or to discriminate among conflicting alternatives. For an illustration, consider the following example.\n1 Imperial College London\nExample 1 (Referendum). At a party, Zed is having a discussion about the outcome of a possible referendum in the Netherlands on whether to remain in the EU. Two of his interlocutors, Ann and Bob, have diverging views on the outcome of the referendum. Ann claims that the Dutch would vote to leave, whereas Bob maintains that they would vote to stay. If this were all the information available, Zed would form two conflicting arguments, based on believing Ann and Bob, respectively. However, Zed knows that Ann likes big claims based on dubious assumptions, so he trusts Bob more than Ann. This preference information should lead Zed to accepting Bob\u2019s argument, rather than Ann\u2019s.\nIn ABA (details in section 2), Zed\u2019s knowledge (without preferences) can be modelled by letting \u03b1 and \u03b2 be assumptions standing for the possibility to trust Ann and Bob, respectively, and introducing two rules, leave \u2190 \u03b1 and stay \u2190 \u03b2, representing the statements of Zed\u2019s interlocutors; given that Ann and Bob contradict each other, we may set stay and leave to be the contraries of assumptions \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively. Thus, {\u03b1} and {\u03b2} are mutually attacking sets of assumptions. Intuitively, the preference of \u03b2 over \u03b1 should lead one to choose {\u03b2} over {\u03b1} as a unique acceptable extension. This outcome is obtained in ABA+ by using preference information to reverse attacks from an attacker that is less preferred than the attackee: due to the preference of \u03b2 over \u03b1, the attack from {\u03b1} to {\u03b2} is reversed into an attack from {\u03b2} to {\u03b1}, in effect sanctioning {\u03b2} as a unique acceptable extension.\nThere are many formalisms of argumentation with preferences, e.g. [6, 1, 12, 42, 44, 45, 8, 17, 14, 47, 39], including approaches extending ABA, e.g. [43, 37, 55, 60]. This multitude reflects the lack of consensus on how preferences should be accounted for in argumentation in particular, and common-sense reasoning in general (also see e.g. [18, 41, 29]). A way to discriminate and evaluate distinct formalisms is to investigate their formal properties. In this paper we show that ABA+ satisfies various desirable properties of argumentation with preferences. We also show that attack reversal differentiates ABA+ from the majority of approaches to argumentation with preferences which discard attacks due to preference information (see e.g. [1, 12, 42, 17, 14,"}, {"heading": "39, 50, 22, 32]).", "text": "The idea of reversing attacks is shared with Preference-based Argumentation Frameworks (PAFs) [6]\u2014an AA-based formalism accommodating preferences. PAFs, as well as some structured argumentation formalisms (e.g. [14]), assume preferences as given on the meta level, particularly over arguments. Instead, ABA+ assumes preferences as given on the object level, particularly over assumptions, similarly to the well known structured argumentation formalism ASPIC+ [47, 21, 49, 46] (which, however, accommodates preferences over rules too). Most existing approaches assume (e.g. [6, 14]) or perform (e.g. [47, 60]) an aggregation of objectlevel preferences to give meta-level preferences over arguments (e.g. [6, 14, 47] or extensions (e.g. [6, 60]). Instead, ABA+ incorporates preferences given over assumptions directly into the\n2 Imperial College London\ndefinition of attack.\nWith respect to ABA, existing approaches (notably [43, 37, 55, 60]) have so far accommodated preferences within the class of so-called flat ABA frameworks [15], where assumptions cannot themselves be deduced from other assumptions. Non-flat ABA frameworks are however useful for knowledge representation, as exemplified next.\nExample 2 (Referendum example extended). Suppose that Dan joins the conversation of Zed, Ann and Bob, and says that one should always trust Bob. A natural way to model this in ABA is to add an assumption \u03b4, standing for trust in Dan, as well as a rule \u03b2 \u2190 \u03b4, representing Dan\u2019s statement about Bob. Such a representation would result into a non-flat ABA framework, because the assumption \u03b2 is deducible from another assumption, namely \u03b4.\nABA+ handles preferences in both flat and non-flat frameworks, thus forgoing possible limitations to expressiveness. We show that, in general, ABA+ conservatively extends ABA and satisfies various desirable properties regarding relationship among semantics (see e.g. [15, 35]), rationality postulates (see e.g. [21]), and preference handling (see e.g. [6, 3, 19, 53]). We also show that flat ABA+ frameworks satisfy additional desirable properties, subject to the principle of Weak Contraposition that we propose in this paper, and which is a relaxed version of the principle of contraposition utilised notably in ASPIC+ to obtain desirable outcomes.\nThe paper is organised as follows. We provide background on ABA in section 2 and present ABA+ in section 3. In section 4 we study properties of semantics, preference handling and rationality in ABA+. We introduce Weak Contraposition in section 5 and investigate its effects on flat ABA+ frameworks in section 6. We devote section 7 for comparing ABA+ to several formalisms of argumentation with preferences. We conclude in section 8.\nThe precursor to this research is the recently published short paper [26], where we presented the main idea and basics of ABA+. With respect to that work, in section 3 we extend ABA+ to non-flat frameworks and define new semantics (ideal). Sections 4.2 and 4.3 are new, whereas section 4.4 significantly expands its precursor subsection \u2018Rationality Postulates\u2019 in [26] with new results (starting from Principle 5). The rest of the paper, i.e. sections 5, 6 and 7, consists of new material."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We base the following ABA background on [15, 59].\nAn ABA framework is a tuple (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af), where: \u2022 (L,R) is a deductive system with L a language (a set of sentences) and R a set of rules\nof the form \u03d50 \u2190 \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m with m > 0 and \u03d5i \u2208 L for i \u2208 {0, . . . , m};\n\u2013 \u03d50 is referred to as the head of the rule, and\n3 Imperial College London\n\u2013 \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m is referred to as the body of the rule; \u2013 if m = 0, then the rule \u03d50 \u2190 \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m is said to have an empty body, and is written\nas \u03d50 \u2190 \u22a4, where \u22a4 6\u2208 L;\n\u2022 A \u2286 L is a non-empty set, whose elements are referred to as assumptions ; \u2022 \u00af\u0304 : A \u2192 L is a total map: for \u03b1 \u2208 A, the L-sentence \u03b1 is referred to as the contrary of \u03b1. In the remainder of this section, unless specified differently, we assume as given a fixed but\notherwise arbitrary ABA framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af).\nA deduction for \u03d5 \u2208 L supported by S \u2286 L and R \u2286 R, denoted by S \u22a2R \u03d5, is a finite tree\nwith\n\u2022 the root labelled by \u03d5, \u2022 leaves labelled by \u22a4 or elements from S, \u2022 the children of non-leaf nodes \u03c8 labelled by the elements of the body of some rule from\nR with head \u03c8, and R being the set of all such rules.\nFor E \u2286 L, the conclusions Cn(E) of E is the set of sentences for which deductions sup-\nported by subsets of E exist, i.e.\nCn(E) = {\u03d5 \u2208 L : \u2203 S \u22a2R \u03d5, S \u2286 E, R \u2286 R}.\nSemantics of ABA frameworks are defined in terms of sets of assumptions meeting desirable requirements. One such requirement is being closed under deduction, defined as follows. For E \u2286 L, the closure Cl(E) of E is the set of assumptions that can be deduced from E, i.e.\nCl(E) = {\u03b1 \u2208 A : \u2203 S \u22a2R \u03b1, S \u2286 E, R \u2286 R} = Cn(E) \u2229A.\nA set A \u2286 A of assumptions is closed iff A = Cl(A). We say that (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) is flat iff every A \u2286 A is closed. We will see later that flat ABA frameworks exhibit additional properties to those of generic ABA frameworks.\nThe remaining desirable requirements met by sets of assumptions, as semantics for ABA frameworks, are given in terms of a notion of attack between sets of assumptions, defined as follows. A set A \u2286 A of assumptions attacks a set B \u2286 A of assumptions, denoted A B,1 iff there is a deduction A\u2032 \u22a2R \u03b2, for some \u03b2 \u2208 B, supported by some A\u2032 \u2286 A and R \u2286 R. If it is not the case that A attacks B, then we may write A 6 B. (We will adopt an analogous convention for other attack relations throughout the paper.)\nTo define ABA semantics, we use the following auxiliary notions. For E \u2286 A: \u2022 E is conflict-free iff E 6 E;\n1We use the symbol instead of the commonly used \u2192 to denote attacks in order to avoid confusion, when \u2192 (or \u2190 in the case of ABA) is used to denote rules in structured argumentation, e.g. ASPIC+ (see section 7).\n4 Imperial College London\n\u2022 E defends A \u2286 A iff for all closed B \u2286 A with B A it holds that E B.2 ABA semantics are as follows. A set E \u2286 A of assumptions (also called an extension) is: \u2022 admissible iff E is closed, conflict-free and defends itself; \u2022 preferred iff E is \u2286-maximally admissible; \u2022 complete iff E is admissible and contains every set of assumptions it defends; \u2022 stable iff E is closed and E {\u03b2} for every \u03b2 \u2208 A \\ E; \u2022 well-founded iff E is the intersection of all complete extensions; \u2022 ideal iff E is \u2286-maximal among sets of assumptions that are\n\u2013 admissible, and \u2013 contained in all preferred extensions.\nNote that ideal sets of assumptions were originally defined by [35] in the context of flat ABA frameworks only. The original definition naturally generalises to any, possibly non-flat, ABA frameworks as given above. Note also that, in the case of flat ABA frameworks, the term grounded is conventionally used instead of well-founded (e.g. in [35]): we will adopt this convention too later in the paper.\nWe illustrate various ABA concepts with a formalisation of the Referendum example from\nthe Introduction.\nExample 3 (Example 1 as a flat ABA framework). The information given in Example 1 can be represented as an ABA framework FZ = (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) with\n\u2022 language L = {\u03b1, \u03b2, leave, stay}, \u2022 set of rules R = {leave \u2190 \u03b1, stay \u2190 \u03b2}, \u2022 set of assumptions A = {\u03b1, \u03b2}, \u2022 contraries given by: \u03b1 = stay, \u03b2 = leave. Here \u03b1 and \u03b2 stand for the possibility to trust Ann and Bob, respectively, and rules leave \u2190 \u03b1 and stay \u2190 \u03b2 represent the statements of Zed\u2019s interlocutors. Note that FZ is flat. In FZ , we find that {\u03b1} and {\u03b2} attack each other, and both of them attack and are attacked by {\u03b1, \u03b2}, which also attacks itself. FZ can be graphically represented as follows (in illustrations of ABA frameworks, nodes hold sets of assumptions while directed edges indicate attacks):\nFZ has two preferred and stable extensions {\u03b1} and {\u03b2}, with conclusions Cn({\u03b1}) =\n2Defence in ABA can be equivalently defined \u2018pointwise\u2019, i.e. E defends A \u2286 A iff for all \u03b1 \u2208 A, for all closed B \u2286 A with B {\u03b1} it holds that E B.\n5 Imperial College London\n{\u03b1, leave} and Cn({\u03b2}) = {\u03b2, stay}, respectively. FZ has a unique grounded (well-founded) and ideal extension \u2205, with conclusions Cn(\u2205) = \u2205. Furthermore, all of {\u03b1}, {\u03b2} and \u2205 are admissible and complete extensions.\nSimilarly, the extended Referendum example can be represented in ABA, but via a non-flat\nABA framework, as follows.\nExample 4 (Example 2 as a non-flat ABA framework). The situation where Dan joins the conversation can be represented by a non-flat ABA framework FD, which is FZ from Example 3 extended with an additional rule \u03b2 \u2190 \u03b4 and an additional assumption \u03b4 (standing for trust in Dan). Overall, FD has\n\u2022 L = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, leave, stay, \u03b4},3 \u2022 R = {leave \u2190 \u03b1, stay \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2190 \u03b4}, \u2022 A = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4}, \u2022 \u03b1 = stay, \u03b2 = leave. In FD, if a set of assumptions contains \u03b4, then it is closed only if it also contains \u03b2. Thus, the only admissible extensions of FD are \u2205, {\u03b1}, {\u03b2} and {\u03b2, \u03b4}. Also, {\u03b2, \u03b4} is a unique stable extension of FD, whereas both {\u03b1} and {\u03b2, \u03b4} are preferred. \u2205 is thus a unique well-founded and ideal extension of FD, and only {\u03b2, \u03b4} is complete.\nWe also recall, from [30], that an AA framework is a pair (Args, ) with a set Args of arguments and a binary attack relation on Args. A set E \u2286 Args of arguments attacks an argument B \u2208 Args, written E B in this paper, iff there is A \u2208 E with A B; also, E attacks a set E \u2032 \u2286 Args of arguments, written E E \u2032 in this paper, iff there is B \u2208 E \u2032 with E B. Then a set E \u2286 Args is conflict-free iff E 6 E; also, E defends A \u2208 Args iff for all B A we find E B. Definition of semantics in terms (grounded, ideal, stable, preferred, complete, admissible) extensions of AA frameworks is the same as for (flat) ABA frameworks but with \u2018assumptions\u2019 replaced by \u2018arguments\u2019 (and the closure condition dropped).\n3 ABA+\nWe extend ABA frameworks (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) with a preference ordering 6 on the set A of assumptions to obtain ABA+ frameworks (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6), as follows.\nDefinition 1. An ABA+ framework is a tuple (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6), where (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) is an ABA framework and 6 is a transitive binary relation on A.\n3Throughout the paper, we often slightly abuse notation and, unless specified otherwise, simply assume that the contrary \u03b4 of any assumption \u03b4 is actually a symbol in the language L, wherefore we do not need to specify (some part of) the contrary mapping separately.\n6 Imperial College London\nWe henceforth apply the notions of conclusions, closure and flatness to ABA+ frameworks, having in mind their underlying ABA frameworks. The strict counterpart < of 6 is defined as \u03b1 < \u03b2 iff \u03b1 6 \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u03b1, for any \u03b1 and \u03b2.4 The Referendum example can be used to illustrate the concept of an ABA+ framework thus.\nExample 5 (Example 1 as a flat ABA+ framework). Recall the ABA framework FZ from Example 3 representing Zed\u2019s knowledge. From Example 1, we know that Zed trusts Bob more than Ann. Hence, we may form a preference over Zed\u2019s assumptions, namely \u03b1 < \u03b2. So we obtain an ABA+ framework F+Z = (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) with\n\u2022 the underlying ABA framework FZ (from Example 3) and \u2022 the preference ordering 6 over A given by \u03b1 < \u03b2.\nDifferently from some other structured argumentation approaches, such as for example ASPIC+ [47] or DeLP [39], we consider preferences on assumptions rather than (defeasible) rules. This is not, however, a conceptual difference, since assumptions are the only defeasible component in ABA and ABA+. Also note that, similarly to the approach in [32], 6 may or may not be a preorder (a reflexive and transitive binary relation), i.e. we do not require reflexivity.\nFrom now on, unless stated differently, we consider a fixed but otherwise arbitrary ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6), and implicitly assume (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) to be its underlying ABA framework.\nWe next define the attack relation in ABA+. The idea is that when the attacker has an\nassumption less preferred than the one attacked, then the attack is reversed.\nDefinition 2. A \u2286 A <-attacks B \u2286 A, denoted A < B, just in case:\n\u2022 either there is a deduction A\u2032 \u22a2R \u03b2, for some \u03b2 \u2208 B, supported by A\u2032 \u2286 A, and \u2204\u03b1\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032\nwith \u03b1\u2032 < \u03b2;\n\u2022 or there is a deduction B\u2032 \u22a2R \u03b1, for some \u03b1 \u2208 A, supported by B\u2032 \u2286 B, and \u2203\u03b2 \u2032 \u2208 B\u2032\nwith \u03b2 \u2032 < \u03b1.\nWe call an <-attack formed as in the first bullet point above a normal attack,5 and an\n<-attack formed as in the second bullet point above a reverse attack.\nIntuitively, A < B as a normal attack if A B and no assumption of A used in this attack is strictly less preferred than the attacked assumption (from B). Otherwise, B < A as a reverse attack if A B and this attack depends on at least one assumption that is strictly less preferred than the attacked one.\n4We assume this definition for the strict counterpart of any order used later in this paper, e.g. for PAFs and ASPIC+.\n5Our notion of normal attack is different from the one proposed by [32], which will be discussed in section 7.4.\n7 Imperial College London\nExample 6 (Attacks in the flat ABA+ framework representing Example 1). Recall the ABA+ framework F+Z from Example 5. In F + Z , {\u03b1} \u2018tries\u2019 to attack {\u03b2}, but is prevented by the preference \u03b1 < \u03b2. Instead, {\u03b2} <-attacks {\u03b1} (and also {\u03b1, \u03b2}) via reverse attack. Likewise, {\u03b1, \u03b2} <-attacks both itself and {\u03b1} via reverse attack. F+Z can be represented graphically as follows (here and later, double-tipped arrows denote attacks that are both normal and reverse):\nIn contrast with the ABA framework FZ , where {\u03b1} defends against is attackers, in the ABA+ framework F+Z , {\u03b1} is <-attacked by, in particular, {\u03b2}, but does not <-attack it back. This concords with the intended meaning of the preference \u03b1 < \u03b2, that the conflict should be resolved in favour of \u03b2.\nThis concept of <-attack reflects the interplay between deductions, contraries and preferences, by representing inherent conflicts among sets of assumptions while accounting for preference information. Normal attacks follow the standard notion of attack in ABA, additionally preventing the attack to succeed when the attacker uses assumptions less preferred than the one attacked. Reverse attacks, meanwhile, resolve the conflict between two sets of assumptions by favouring the one containing an assumption whose contrary is deduced, over the one which uses less preferred assumptions to deduce that contrary.\nWe next define the notions of conflict-freeness and defence with respect to <, and then\nintroduce ABA+ semantics.\nDefinition 3. For E \u2286 A:\n\u2022 E is <-conflict-free if E 6 < E; \u2022 E <-defends A \u2286 A if for all closed B \u2286 A with B < A it holds that E < B.\nABA+ semantics can be defined by replacing, in the standard ABA semantics definition,\nthe notions of attack and defence with those of <-attack and <-defence, as follows.\nDefinition 4. A set E \u2286 A of assumptions (also called an extension) is:\n\u2022 <-admissible if E closed, <-conflict-free and <-defends itself; \u2022 <-preferred if E is \u2286-maximally <-admissible; \u2022 <-complete if E is <-admissible and contains every set of assumptions it <-defends; \u2022 <-stable, if E is closed, <-conflict-free and E < {\u03b2} for every \u03b2 \u2208 A \\ E; \u2022 <-well-founded if E is the intersection of all <-complete extensions;\n8 Imperial College London\n\u2022 <-ideal if E is \u2286-maximal among sets of assumptions that are\n\u2013 <-admissible, and \u2013 contained in all preferred <-extensions.\nNote: similarly to the convention in ABA, in the case of flat ABA+ frameworks we may use\nthe term <-grounded instead of <-well-founded.\nThe following examples illustrate ABA+ semantics.\nExample 7 (Extensions of the flat ABA+ framework representing Example 1). The flat ABA+ framework F+Z from Example 6 has <-admissible extensions \u2205 and {\u03b2}. In particular, {\u03b1} is not <-admissible in F+Z because it does not <-defend against, for instance, {\u03b2}. Also, {\u03b1, \u03b2} is not <-admissible, because not <-conflict-free. Hence, F+Z has a unique <-complete, <-preferred, <-stable, <-ideal and <-grounded extension {\u03b2}, with conclusions Cn({\u03b2}) = {\u03b2, stay}.\nExample 8 (Example 2 as a non-flat ABA+ framework and extensions thereof). Taking the non-flat ABA framework FD = (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) from Example 4 and equipping it with preference information \u03b1 < \u03b2 yields a non-flat ABA+ framework F+D = (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) which has a unique <-complete, <-preferred, <-stable, <-ideal and <-well-founded extension {\u03b2, \u03b4} with conclusions Cn({\u03b2, \u03b4}) = {\u03b2, \u03b4, stay}.\nLet us consider a slightly more complex setting, by way of building on our Referendum\nexample.\nExample 9 (Example 1 extended and represented as a flat ABA+ framework, and extensions thereof). Carl also joins the conversation, and Zed quickly summarises the discussion by saying that if one were to believe Ann, it would be \u2018leave\u2019, whereas if one were to trust Bob, then it would be \u2018stay\u2019. Carl does not quite get at first what the conversation is about, but swiftly completes the statements (as if they were enthymemes) with a missing premise \u2018if there is a referendum\u2019. Carl also distrusts Ann, and so believes in the possibility of a referendum and in what Bob is saying more than in what Ann says. Arguably, given Carl\u2019s preferences, he should also be convinced by Bob rather than Ann.\nThe information available to Carl can be represented in ABA+ similarly as for Zed in Example 3, but with the additional assumption \u03b3 standing for the possibility of the referendum, and the rules leave \u2190 \u03b1, \u03b3 and stay \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b3 instead. Overall, Carl\u2019s ABA+ framework is F+C = (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) with\n\u2022 L = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, leave, stay, \u03b3}, \u2022 R = {leave \u2190 \u03b1, \u03b3, stay \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b3}, \u2022 A = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3}, \u2022 \u03b1 = stay, \u03b2 = leave,\n9 Imperial College London\n\u2022 \u03b1 < \u03b2, \u03b1 < \u03b3.

Also, {\u03b2, \u03b3} <-attacks {\u03b1}, as well as any set containing \u03b1, via normal attack, because no assumption in {\u03b2, \u03b3} is less preferred than \u03b1.\nThe framework F+C has a unique <-complete, <-preferred, <-stable, <-ideal and<-grounded extension, namely {\u03b2, \u03b3}, with conclusions Cn({\u03b2, \u03b3}) = {\u03b2, \u03b3, stay}, arguably a desirable outcome.\nHenceforth, we focus on \u03c3 \u2208 {well-founded/grounded, ideal, stable, preferred, complete}\nand use \u03c3 and <-\u03c3 to refer to ABA and ABA+ semantics, respectively.\nWe conclude this section with the observations that attacks in ABA can be viewed as <- attacks in ABA+ when preferences are absent (Lemma 1), and thus that ABA+ is a conservative extension of ABA (Theorem 2).\nLemma 1.

Rationality postulates have not been studied in ABA in general (but see [56] for an analysis with respect to a version of ABA, and [46] for an analysis of a restricted form of flat ABA). We now study these postulates in ABA+ in general. In particular, following [46], we provide their precise formulations for ABA+ in general, as well as for a restricted class of ABA+ frameworks incorporating classical negation. We also establish the satisfaction of the postulates in general, and delineate conditions under which ABA+ satisfies the postulates for the restricted class of frameworks.\nWe define the postulates using the following auxiliary definitions.\nDefinition 5. S \u2286 L is:\n\u2022 directly consistent if there are no \u03d5, \u03c8 \u2208 S with \u03d5 = \u03c8; \u2022 indirectly consistent if Cn(S) is directly consistent.\nTheorem 5 implies that <-conflict-free sets are (in)directly consistent.\nLemma 10. Any closed and <-conflict-free set E \u2286 A is both directly and indirectly consistent.\nProof. As E is <-conflict-free, it is conflict-free, by Theorem 5. Suppose for a contradiction that E is not directly consistent. Then there are \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E such that \u03b1 = \u03b2. But as {\u03b1} \u22a2\u2205 \u03b1 is a deduction supported by {\u03b1} \u2286 E, we get E E, contradicting conflict-freeness of E.\nLikewise, suppose E is not indirectly consistent. Then there are \u03d5, \u03b2 \u2208 Cn(E) such that \u03d5 = \u03b2, and as E is closed, \u03b2 \u2208 E. But then there is a deduction \u03a6 \u22a2R \u03d5 supported by some \u03a6 \u2286 E, so that E E, which is a contradiction.\nWe next formulate the rationality postulates for ABA+.\nPrinciple 4. Let E1, . . . , En be <-\u03c3 extensions of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6). Then (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) fulfils, for <-\u03c3 semantics, the Principle of\n\u2022 Closure if Cn(Ei) = Cn(Cn(Ei)) \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}; 7 \u2022 Consistency if Ei is directly consistent \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}; \u2022 Indirect Consistency if Ei is indirectly consistent \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nSatisfaction of these principles is guaranteed in ABA+, as shown next.\nTheorem 11. (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) fulfils the principles of Closure, Consistency and Indirect Consistency, for any semantics <-\u03c3.\nProof. Satisfaction of the Principle of Closure is immediate from the definition of the conclusions operator Cn (Definition 2), and fulfilment of the principles of Direct and Indirect Consistency follows from Lemma 10. 7The idea of this principle is that conclusions of extensions should be deductively closed with respect to the deductive system (L,R), and, in the case of ABA+, the conclusions operator Cn is the deductive closure operator; in ASPIC+ the operator of closure under strict rules is used instead, see [46] for details.\n15 Imperial College London\nWe note that [21] originally intended the postulates to account for classical negation. Classical negation is not, however, singled-out in [46]\u2019s formulations of the postulates. Nevertheless, the original intentions can be accounted for by appropriately formulating the principle of \u2018classical consistency\u2019 for ABA+, and by formally describing what is required of ABA+ frameworks to fulfil this principle. We do this next, following [21, 46].\nFor the remainder of this section, we assume the language L to be closed under the classical negation operator \u00ac. As a shorthand, the complement \u2212\u03d5 of \u03d5 \u2208 L is: \u00ac\u03c8 if \u03d5 = \u03c8; and \u03c8 if \u03d5 = \u00ac\u03c8.\nPrinciple 5. Let E1, . . . , En be all the <-\u03c3 extensions of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6). Then (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) fulfils the Principle of Classical Consistency for <-\u03c3 semantics just in case for no \u03d5 \u2208 L it holds that both \u03d5 \u2208 Cn(Ei) and \u2212\u03d5 \u2208 Cn(Ei), for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nObviously, if the rules of an ABA+ framework include a sentence and its negation as rules with empty bodies, then the Principle of Classical Consistency is violated, as illustrated below.\nExample 11. Consider (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af, \u2205) with\n\u2022 L = {p,\u00acp, \u03b1,\u00ac\u03b1}, \u2022 R = {p \u2190 \u22a4, \u00acp \u2190 \u22a4}, \u2022 A = {\u03b1}, \u03b1 = p. Then \u2205 \u22a2{p\u2190\u22a4} p and \u2205 \u22a2{\u00acp\u2190\u22a4} \u00acp, and so \u2205 is a unique <-admissible extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6), and has Cn(\u2205) = {p,\u00acp}. Thus, \u2205 is unique <-\u03c3 extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) for any \u03c3, and therefore, this ABA+ framework violates the Principle of Classical Consistency.\nTo avoid such situations, we can impose a restriction\u2014akin to the property of axiom con-\nsistency from [46]\u2014on ABA+ frameworks, as follows.\nAxiom 1. (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Consistency just in case for no \u03d5 \u2208 L there are deductions \u2205 \u22a2R \u03d5 and \u2205 \u22a2R \u2032 \u2212\u03d5, for any R,R\u2032 \u2286 R.\nClearly, (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) from Example 11 does not satisfy the Axiom of Consistency. We now propose a property of ABA+ frameworks whose satisfaction, together with the\nAxiom of Consistency, leads to fulfilment of the Principle of Classical Consistency.\nAxiom 2. (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Negation just in case for all A \u2286 A, R \u2286 R and \u03d5 \u2208 L it holds that if A \u22a2R \u03d5 and A 6= \u2205, then for some \u03b1 \u2208 A it holds that \u03b1 = \u2212\u03d5.\nThe axiom of Negation essentially requires that if an assumption can be used to derive a sentence, then the negation of that sentence should be the contrary of that assumption. Note that this axiom is somewhat restrictive in that it forces the contrary of some assumption to be a particular sentence. However, this syntactic restriction is not a semantic restriction, because\n16 Imperial College London\nif another sentence, say \u03c8, is wanted as the contrary of \u03b1, then rules \u2212\u03d5 \u2190 \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2190 \u2212\u03d5 can be added to the framework. Another possibility would be to have a more general contrary mapping \u00af\u0304\u0304 : A \u2192 \u2118(L) which assigns a set of contraries to each assumption, just like in some formulations of ABA (see e.g. [59, 37]) equivalent to the standard presentation we adopt in this paper. Alternative formulations of the Axiom of Negation are beyond the scope of this paper, and are left as future work.\nSatisfaction of the axioms of Consistency and Negation guarantees fulfilment of the Principle\nof Classical Consistency, as our next result shows.\nProposition 12. If (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) satisfies both axioms of Consistency and Negation, then (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) fulfils the Principle of Classical Consistency for any semantics <-\u03c3.\nProof. Fix \u03c3 and let E be a <-\u03c3 extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6). Suppose for a contradiction that for some \u03d5 \u2208 L we have \u03d5,\u2212\u03d5 \u2208 Cn(E). Then, by the Axiom of Consistency, there must be deductions A \u22a2R \u03d5 and B \u22a2R \u2032 \u2212\u03d5 with at least one of A,B \u2286 E non-empty. Say A 6= \u2205. Thus, by the Axiom of Negation, we have \u03b1 = \u2212\u03d5, for some \u03b1 \u2208 A. Thus, A \u222a B, and as a consequence E, is not conflict-free, and hence not <-conflict-free (by Theorem 5). This is a contradiction. Therefore, for no \u03d5 \u2208 L we have \u03d5,\u2212\u03d5 \u2208 Cn(E). Thus, as \u03c3 was arbitrary, (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) fulfils the Principle of Classical Consistency for any semantics <-\u03c3.\nThis result shows, given the class of ABA+ frameworks with classical negation in the language, how to satisfy classical consistency. In particular, it suffices to ensure that the nondefeasible part of the ABA+ framework is consistent (the Axiom of Consistency), and to accordingly incorporate the negation into the contrary mapping. (Such an approach was also pursued by [56].) Note, however, that this is a different approach than the one indirectly proposed by [46] for flat ABA frameworks as instances of ASPIC+, where, in particular, contraposition on rules was suggested (consult section 5 and Appendix B). The conditions that we identify are different from those proposed in [46], because ASPIC+ employs a contrariness function (consult Appendix B) which is different from the contrary mapping in ABA/ABA+.\nIn this section we saw that non-flat ABA+ frameworks exhibit various desirable properties proposed in the literature. It is known that flat ABA frameworks exhibit additional properties in terms of relationship among semantics [15, 35]. ASPIC+ too adheres to various principles, such as rationality postulates, whenever contraposition on rules is imposed.8 In the next section, we propose a relaxed version of contraposition, called Weak Contraposition, and in section 6 show that, subject to Weak Contraposition, flat ABA+ frameworks exhibit additional desirable properties too.\n8Equivalently, transposition, as proposed by [21], can be used; we focus on contraposition in this paper.\n17 Imperial College London"}, {"heading": "5 Weak Contraposition", "text": "We have shown (Proposition 7) that conflict preservation is always guaranteed in ABA+. In order to ensure conflict preservation in other approaches, notably ASPIC+, contraposition can be utilised, as illustrated next.9\nExample 12. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 be ordinary premises, with contradictories \u00ac\u03b1 and \u00ac\u03b2, respectively, and let \u03b2 \u2192 \u00ac\u03b1 be a strict rule. ASPIC+ (without contraposition) produces arguments A = [\u03b1], B = [\u03b2] and B\u2032 = [B \u2192 \u00ac\u03b1], and a single attack B\u2032 A. Since there are no defeasible rules, B\u2032 is less preferred than A (in symbols, B\u2032 \u227a A), with respect to any standard argument comparison principle employed in ASPIC+. Hence, the attack fails and there are no defeats, so that {A,B,B\u2032} is undefeated, yet self-attacking.\nContraposition forces to add, for instance, a strict rule \u03b1 \u2192 \u00ac\u03b2, hence giving an additional argument A\u2032 = [A \u2192 \u00ac\u03b2] defeating both B and B\u2032 (under any argument comparison principle). As a result, the desirable {A,A\u2032} is obtained as a unique acceptable extension if contraposition is imposed.\nFormally, the principle of contraposition can be expressed in ABA+ as follows.\nAxiom 3. (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition just in case for all A \u2286 A, R \u2286 R and \u03b2 \u2208 A it holds that\nif A \u22a2R \u03b2,\nthen for every \u03b1 \u2208 A, there is A\u03b1 \u22a2 R\u03b1 \u03b1, for some A\u03b1 \u2286 (A \\ {\u03b1}) \u222a {\u03b2} and R\u03b1 \u2286 R.\nThis axiom requires that if an assumption plays a role in deducing the contrary of another assumption, then it should be possible for the latter to contribute to a deduction of the contrary of the former assumption too.\nIn ABA+, the Axiom of Contraposition is not required to guarantee conflict preservation (as sanctioned by Proposition 7), but restrictions on ABA+ frameworks may be needed to ensure other properties, such as existence of <-complete extensions, which need not be guaranteed in general: the ABA+ framework from Example 10 has no <-complete extension, because all the singletons {\u03b1}, {\u03b2} and {\u03b3} are <-unattacked, but {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3} is not <-conflict-free.\nWe will prove (in section 6) that a relaxed version of contraposition, formulated below, suffices to guarantee desirable properties, such as, in particular, the so-called Fundamental Lemma (see e.g. [30, Lemma 10], [15, Theorem 5.7]) and all the properties that follow from it, such as existence of <-complete extensions.\n9Consult Appendix B and e.g. [47, 46] for details on ASPIC+. For our purposes here these details are unnecessary.\n18 Imperial College London\nAxiom 4. (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Weak Contraposition just in case for all A \u2286 A, R \u2286 R and \u03b2 \u2208 A it holds that\nif A \u22a2R \u03b2 and there exists \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 A such that \u03b1\u2032 < \u03b2,\nthen, for some \u03b1 \u2208 A which is 6-minimal such that \u03b1 < \u03b2, there is A\u03b1 \u22a2 R\u03b1 \u03b1, for some A\u03b1 \u2286 (A \\ {\u03b1}) \u222a {\u03b2} and R\u03b1 \u2286 R.\nThis axiom insists on contraposing only when a deduction involves assumptions less preferred than the one whose contrary is deduced. Clearly, satisfaction of the Axiom of Contraposition implies satisfaction of the Axiom of Weak Contraposition. However, satisfaction of the Axiom of Weak Contraposition does not imply satisfaction of the Axiom of Contraposition, as explained next.\nConsider the ABA+ framework F+C from Example 9. There is a deduction {\u03b1, \u03b3} \u22a2 {leave\u2190\u03b1,\u03b3} leave, where leave = \u03b2 and \u03b1 < \u03b2, which satisfies the antecedent of the Axiom of Weak Contraposition. Nonetheless, there is also a deduction {\u03b2, \u03b3} \u22a2{stay\u2190\u03b2,\u03b3} stay, where stay = \u03b1 and \u03b2 6< \u03b1, \u03b3 6< \u03b1, which satisfies the consequent of the Axiom of Weak Contraposition. As there are no other deductions that satisfy the antecedent of the Axiom of Weak Contraposition, F+C satisfies this axiom. However, F + C violates the Axiom of Contraposition, because, for instance, the existence of the deduction {\u03b1, \u03b3} \u22a2{leave\u2190\u03b1,\u03b3} leave satisfies the antecedent of the Axiom of Contraposition, but there is no deduction S \u22a2R \u03b3 with S \u2286 {\u03b1, \u03b2}, which is a violation of the consequent of the Axiom of Contraposition.\nIn essence, satisfaction of the Axiom of Weak Contraposition ensures that, given a \u2286- minimally non-<-conflict-free set S of assumptions, some least preferred (i.e. 6-minimal) assumption \u03b1 \u2208 S is <-attacked (via normal attack) by the rest of the set (i.e. S \\ {\u03b1}). Thus, the Axiom of Weak Contraposition has a similar effect as the inconsistency resolving property recently proposed by [31, Definition 8]. However, the latter does not take preferences into account. Formal correspondence between the Axiom of Weak Contraposition and Dung\u2019s inconsistency resolving property is a line of future work.\nNote also that any ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af, \u2205) (i.e. when preference information is absent) automatically satisfies the Axiom of Weak Contraposition, without forcing any new rules. This is a welcome feature, because, as discussed in [11], standard contraposition together with general contrariness mappings, notably the one in ASPIC+, may lead to certain unintended behaviours when preferences are not present.\nThis ensures that a set whose members are individually <-unattacked must be <-conflictfree, which essentially suffices for the Fundamental Lemma and other properties to hold in ABA+, as we will in section 6.\n19 Imperial College London\nIn the next section we show that the Axiom of Weak Contraposition allows flat ABA+ frameworks to retain the relationships among semantics known to hold among semantics of flat ABA frameworks, which then allows to extend Proposition 9 to the rest of semantics considered in this paper.\n6 Properties of Flat ABA+ Frameworks Satisfying the\nAxiom of Weak Contraposition\nIn this section, unless stated otherwise, we assume as given a flat ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6 ) that satisfies the Axiom of Weak Contraposition.\nWe first prove that Weak Contraposition suffices for the Fundamental Lemma to hold in\nflat ABA+:\nLemma 13 (Fundamental Lemma). Let S \u2286 A be <-admissible and assume that S <-defends {\u03b1}, {\u03b1\u2032} \u2286 A. Then S \u222a {\u03b1} is <-admissible and <-defends {\u03b1\u2032}.\nNote that, without Weak Contraposition, the Fundamental Lemma need not hold: in Example 10, (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) is flat but violates the Axiom of Weak Contraposition, and {\u03b2, \u03b3} is <-admissible and <-defends {\u03b1} (because {\u03b1} is <-unattacked), but {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3} is not <-conflictfree and thus not <-admissible.\nLemma 13 implies that, subject to Weak Contraposition, the following additional properties of ABA+ semantics hold for flat ABA+ frameworks, mirroring the properties held by flat ABA (as well as AA) frameworks.\nTheorem 14. Let F = (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6).\n(i) F has a <-preferred extension.\n(ii) Every <-preferred extension of F is <-complete.\n(iii) F has a <-complete extension. (iv) F has a unique <-grounded extension, which is moreover <-complete.\n(v) F has a unique <-ideal extension, which is moreover <-complete.\nObserve that if an ABA+ framework is non-flat, satisfaction of the Axiom of Weak Contraposition does not guarantee the properties above, since ABA+ conservatively extends ABA (Theorem 2) and these properties can be falsified for non-flat ABA frameworks [15].\nTheorem 14 implies that flat ABA+ frameworks satisfying Weak Contraposition fulfil the Principle of Maximal Elements not only for <-complete, <-stable and <-well-founded semantics (Proposition 9), but also for <-preferred and <-ideal semantics:\n20 Imperial College London\nCorollary 15. If (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) is flat and satisfies the Axiom of Weak Contraposition, then it fulfils the Principle of Maximal Elements for <-preferred and <-ideal semantics.\nProof. By Theorem 14(ii, v), <-preferred and<-ideal extensions are<-complete for (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6 ) flat and satisfying the Axiom of Weak Contraposition. The claim thus follows from Proposition 9.\nInvestigating whether the class of flat ABA+ frameworks satisfying the Axiom of Weak Contraposition is the smallest class for which the results (Lemma 13, Theorem 14, Corollary 15) established in this section hold is left for future work."}, {"heading": "7 Comparison", "text": "In this section we compare ABA+ to formalisms of argumentation with preferences most relevant to ABA+. In particular, we focus on: PAFs [6, 4, 5] as the only other argumentation formalism to use attack reversal (to the best of our knowledge); ABA Equipped with Preferences (p ABA) [60] as the only other formalism extending ABA with preferences; and ASPIC+ [47, 21, 49, 46] as a well known structured argumentation formalism that has been shown to capture flat ABA frameworks as instances. Unless stated otherwise, in this section ABA/ABA+ frameworks are assumed to be flat. This restriction is imposed because p ABA extends (with preferences) flat ABA frameworks; ASPIC+ captures flat ABA frameworks; and PAFs is an AA-based formalism and AA frameworks can both be instantiated with, and seen as instances of, flat ABA frameworks [35, 57]."}, {"heading": "7.1 PAFs", "text": "A Preference-based Argumentation Framework (PAF) (Args, ,4) consists of an AA framework (Args, ) equipped with a (partial) preorder 4 over arguments, which is used to generate a defeat relation, denoted by \u2192\u0592 in this paper, by reversing attacks from less preferred arguments. Formally, given a PAF (Args, ,4), the repaired framework [6] is an AA framework (Args, \u2192\u0592), where A \u2192\u0592 B iff either A B and A \u2280 B, or B A and B \u227a A. A set E \u2286 Args is a \u03c3 extension of (Args, ,4) iff it is a \u03c3 extension of (Args, \u2192\u0592).\nFollowing the way ABA frameworks capture AA frameworks [57], we next show how ABA+ frameworks readily capture PAFs. In what follows, we assume a PAF (Args, ,4) as given, unless stated otherwise. We map each argument A \u2208 Args into an assumption A \u2208 A, together with a new symbol A for the contrary, and map each attack A B into a rule B \u2190 A. The preference ordering 4 is transferred as is to constitute 6. Formally:\n21 Imperial College London\nDefinition 6. The ABA+ framework corresponding to PAF (Args, ,4) is (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) with:\n\u2022 L = Args \u222a {A : A \u2208 Args}, where A 6\u2208 Args; \u2022 R = {B \u2190 A : A B}; \u2022 A = Args; \u2022 each A \u2208 A has contrary A; \u2022 6=4.\nNote that the ABA+ framework corresponding to (Args, ,4) is always flat. Trivially, attacks in a given PAF are in a one-to-one correspondence with <-attacks in the\ncorresponding ABA+ framework, as follows:\nLemma 16. For A,B \u2208 Args, A \u2192\u0592 B iff {A} < {B}.\nProof. A \u2192\u0592 B \u21d4 (i) either A B and A 6< B (ii) or B A and B < A \u21d4 (i) either \u2203 B \u2190 A \u2208 R and A 6< B (ii) or \u2203 A \u2190 B \u2208 R and B < A \u21d4 {A} < {B}.\nFrom the construction of the ABA+ framework corresponding to (Args, ,4) and Lemma 16, we obtain the following correspondence result, which says that, under any semantics \u03c3, every PAF is an instance of ABA+.\nTheorem 17. Let (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) be the corresponding ABA+ framework to (Args, ,4). Then E is a \u03c3 extension of (Args, ,4) iff E is a <-\u03c3 extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6).\nThus, ABA+ can be seen to generalise PAFs, similarly to how ABA generalises AA [57]. It is known that flat ABA frameworks are instances of AA frameworks [35], choosing arguments of the form A : A \u22a2 \u03d5 (where A \u22a2 \u03d5 means there is a deduction A \u22a2R \u03d5 for some R \u2286 R) and attacks A B, for arguments A : A \u22a2 \u03d5 and B : B \u22a2 \u03c8, whenever \u03d5 = \u03b2 for some \u03b2 \u2208 B. Let us see whether flat ABA+ frameworks are similarly instances of PAFs. In order to do this, given a preference relation 6 on A, we can try to define an ordering 4 over arguments. For example, we can utilise the following orderings taken from [46, 61]:\n\u2022 A \u227aEli B if \u2203\u03b1 \u2208 A such that \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 B we find \u03b1 < \u03b2; \u2022 A \u227aDEli B if \u2203\u03b1 \u2208 A \\B such that \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 B \\ A we find \u03b1 < \u03b2; \u2022 A 4Dem B if \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 A we find \u03b2 \u2208 B with \u03b1 6 \u03b2; \u2022 A \u227aDem B if A 4Dem B and B 64Dem A. The three comparison principles Eli, Dem and DEli are referred to as Elitist, Democratic\nand Disjoint Elitist [61], respectively.\nThe following example shows that, whichever argument ordering above is used, the original\nflat ABA+ frameworks and the resulting PAFs are not semantically equivalent.\n22 Imperial College London\nExample 13. Consider the ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) with:\n\u2022 R = {\u03b5 \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032, \u03b2 \u2190 \u03b5, \u03b2 \u2032, \u03b2 \u2032 \u2190 \u03b5, \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 \u2190 \u03b2 \u2032, \u03b1 \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032, \u03b2 \u2190\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2032, \u03b2 \u2032 \u2190 \u03b1, \u03b2},\n\u2022 A = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032, \u03b5}, \u2022 \u03b2 < \u03b5. This ABA+ framework is flat and satisfies the Axiom of Weak Contraposition. Its sets of assumptions that support deductions, together with <-attacks among them, can be depicted graphically as follows (highlights are to improve readability):\nIn essence, disregarding the other deductions, the self-<-attacking set {\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032} deduces the contraries of both \u03b1 and \u03b5, and as \u03b2 is less preferred than \u03b5, the set {\u03b5} <-attacks {\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032} (via reverse attack), thus effectively <-defending {\u03b1}. Overall, (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) has a unique <-complete extension S = {\u03b5, \u03b1}, which is <-preferred, <-grounded and <-ideal (by Theorem 14).\nIn ABA (ignoring the preferences), the following arguments (named, for ease of reference) can be obtained: E : {\u03b5} \u22a2 \u03b5; B : {\u03b2} \u22a2 \u03b2; B\u2032 : {\u03b2 \u2032} \u22a2 \u03b2 \u2032; A : {\u03b1} \u22a2 \u03b1; X\u03b5 : {\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032} \u22a2 \u03b5; EB \u2032 : {\u03b5, \u03b2 \u2032} \u22a2 \u03b2; EB : {\u03b5, \u03b2} \u22a2 \u03b2 \u2032; B : {\u03b2} \u22a2 \u03b2; B\u2032 : {\u03b2 \u2032} \u22a2 \u03b2 \u2032; X\u03b1 : {\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032} \u22a2 \u03b1; AB \u2032 : {\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2032} \u22a2 \u03b2; AB : {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u22a2 \u03b2 \u2032. These arguments together with attacks among them instantiate an AA framework (Args, ), which can be depicted graphically as follows:\n23 Imperial College London\nSince the only preference information is \u03b2 < \u03b5, in the three resulting PAFs (employing \u227aEli, \u227aDem and \u227aDEli, respectively) it suffices to check only whether attacks on E succeed as defeats. There is only one such attack, namely X\u03b5 E. We find X\u03b5 \u227aEli E and X\u03b5 \u227aDEli E, while X\u03b5 \u2280Dem E. Note that, even though with respect to the Elitist and Disjoint Elitist comparison principles the attack X\u03b5 E is reversed into the defeat E \u2192\u0592 X\u03b5, the argument E still does not defend A in (Args, \u2192\u0592) (because X\u03b1 A and neither E 6 X\u03b1 nor X\u03b1 E), so that {E} is a unique complete extension of (Args, \u2192\u0592), and hence of (Args, ,4). With respect to the Democratic comparison principle, X\u03b5 \u2192\u0592 E, so that E defends neither A nor itself, and thus \u2205 is a unique complete extension of ((Args, \u2192\u0592) and) (Args, ,4). In any event, we see that acceptable assumptions in ABA+ do not correspond to acceptable arguments in PAFs.\nTo summarise, we showed that PAFs can be seen as instances of (flat) ABA+ frameworks. The converse is not true in the instantiations of PAFs by using standard ABA arguments and well known argument comparison principles, because for these instantiations not all attacks stemming from arguments with the same supporting sets of assumptions are reversed, whereas in ABA+ attacks are reversed between sets of assumptions (supporting possibly multiple deductions).\nWhether other instantiations of PAFs with ABA+ are possible, is left for future work.\n24 Imperial College London"}, {"heading": "7.2 p ABA", "text": "Following [60], a p ABA framework is a tuple (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,4) with (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) the underlying ABA framework and 4 a (partial) preorder over L.10 A preference relation (i.e. preorder) \u2291 over ABA extensions is defined (via [52]\u2019s criterion for comparing answer sets in Logic Programming with preferences) to select the \u2018preferable\u2019 extensions, called P-extensions, of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,4).11 Formally, given a p ABA framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,4), let E be the collection of \u03c3 extensions of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af). A binary preference relation \u2291 over E can be defined as follows: for E,E \u2032, E \u2032\u2032 \u2208 E ,\n\u2022 E \u2291 E \u2032 if there is \u03d5 \u2208 Cn(E \u2032) \\ Cn(E) such that\n\u2013 there is \u03c8 \u2208 Cn(E) \\ Cn(E \u2032) with \u03c8 4 \u03d5 and \u2013 there is no \u03c7 \u2208 Cn(E) \\ Cn(E \u2032) with \u03d5 \u227a \u03c7;\n\u2022 E \u2291 E; \u2022 if E \u2291 E \u2032 and E \u2032 \u2291 E \u2032\u2032, then E \u2291 E \u2032\u2032. Then, a \u03c3 extension E of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) is a \u03c3 P-extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,4) iff E \u2291 E \u2032\nimplies E \u2032 \u2291 E, for any \u03c3 extension E \u2032 of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af).\nObserve that p ABA merely discriminates among extensions of the underlying ABA framework; thus, in Example 6, the unique \u03c3 extension {\u03b1} of the underlying ABA framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af) is a unique \u03c3 P-extension of the p ABA framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,4), disregarding the preference \u03b1 < \u03b2.\nTo see another considerable difference between ABA+ and p ABA, let us consider odd cycles. These frequently prevent existence of, in particular, stable extensions, and may lead to empty grounded extensions. However, when preference information is present, it can break cycles. We illustrate with the following variant of the well known example of a \u20183-cycle\u2019.\nExample 14. Consider R = {\u03b2 \u2190 \u03b1, \u03b3 \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b1 \u2190 \u03b3} and A = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3} with \u03b3 < \u03b2 < \u03b1. In ABA, ignoring the preferences, there is an odd cycle {\u03b1} {\u03b2} {\u03b3} {\u03b1}, and so no stable extension exists, and \u2205 is a unique complete (hence grounded, ideal and preferred) extension. Thus, in p ABA, no stable P-extensions exist either, and P-extensions under other semantics are empty. That is, preferences do not really play a role. In contrast, ABA+ yields a unique <-\u03c3 extension {\u03b1}. The situation is illustrated graphically below.\n10For readability, we use the symbol 4 to differentiate p ABA frameworks from ABA+ frameworks, but in examples to follow we give preferences using 4 and 6 interchangeably.\n11[60] uses the AA framework corresponding to (L,R,A,\u0304 \u00af\u0304) and its argument extensions, as in e.g. [34]. Instead, we provide an equivalent definition on the assumption level (enabled by results from [35] and [57]; see also [59]).\n25 Imperial College London\nStill further, in settings where stable extensions of the underlying ABA framework exist and preferred extensions are non-empty, ABA+ discriminates between extensions differently than p ABA, as shown next.\nExample 15. Let R = {\u03b1 \u2190 \u03b4, \u03b2 \u2190 \u03b1, \u03b3 \u2190 \u03b2, \u03b4 \u2190 \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2190 \u03b4}, A = {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4} and \u03b4 < \u03b1, \u03b3 < \u03b2. In ABA, ignoring the preferences, we obtain two stable (and also preferred) extensions, E = {\u03b1, \u03b3} and E \u2032 = {\u03b2, \u03b4}, and the grounded/ideal extension \u2205. In p ABA, both E and E \u2032 are stable/preferred P-extensions, and \u2205 is the grounded/ideal P-extension. In contrast, E is a unique <-stable/preferred/ideal extension in ABA+, and it is in addition <-grounded. (The situation is illustrated graphically below.)\nGiven that \u03b1 is objected against only by \u03b4, but due to the preference \u03b4 < \u03b1 this objection\nis refuted, ABA+ accepts \u03b1, which, arguably, is the correct outcome.\nTo summarise, in contrast to ABA+, p ABA accommodates preferences in order to discriminate among extensions of the underlying ABA framework, which may lead to preference information being ineffective and/or the outcomes unintuitive.\n7.3 ASPIC+\nASPIC+ is an expressive argumentation formalism, encompassing many key elements of structured argumentation with preferences (such as strict and defeasible rules, general contrariness mapping, various forms of attack as well as preferences). It was shown by [49] that flat ABA\n26 Imperial College London\nframeworks can be seen as instances of ASPIC+ frameworks (i.e. as a class of ASPIC+ frameworks without preferences). In this section we will show that ABA+ is distinct from ASPIC+ in several respects.\nIn order for ASPIC+ frameworks to behave well (in the sense of satisfying various formal properties, such as the Fundamental Lemma or the rationality postulates of [21]), various requirements have to be met. For instance, contraposition, as discussed in section 5, is used; preferences also have to satisfy certain conditions. The main focus of this section is to exhibit an example which adheres to the standard requirements imposed on ASPIC+ frameworks, but is treated differently in ABA+ and ASPIC+. To this end, we first extend the mapping from ABA to ASPIC+ (without preferences) provided in [49] to a mapping from ABA+ to ASPIC+(with preferences). Details of ASPIC+ sufficient for our purposes in this paper are provided in Appendix B.\nIn what follows, unless specified otherwise, we assume as given a flat ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) with 6 a preorder and \u00af\u0304 : A \u2192 L such that \u03b1 = \u03b1c, where \u03b1c \u2208 L\\A, for any \u03b1 \u2208 A.\nDefinition 7. The ASPIC+ framework corresponding to a flat ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) is (L, C,Rs,Kp,6p) with:\n\u2022 L = L \u222a {\u00acs : s \u2208 L \\ A and s 6= \u03b1c for any \u03b1 \u2208 A}, where \u00acs 6\u2208 L; \u2022 C : L \u2192 \u2118(L) is such that:12\n\u2013 if \u03b1 \u2208 A, then C(\u03b1) = {\u03b1c}, \u2013 if s = \u03b1c for some \u03b1 \u2208 A, then C(s) = {\u03b1}, \u2013 if s \u2208 L \\ A and s 6= \u03b1c for any \u03b1 \u2208 A, then C(s) = {\u00acs} and C(\u00acs) = {s};\n\u2022 Rs = {\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m \u2192 \u03d50 : \u03d50 \u2190 \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m \u2208 R}; \u2022 Kp = A; \u2022 6p =6.\nThe following example shows that under this natural mapping, ASPIC+ deals with preferences differently from ABA+, in the sense that the extensions of the given ABA+ framework have conclusions different from the conclusions of the extensions of the ASPIC+ framework obtained via this mapping, even though the resulting ASPIC+ framework satisfies the standard ASPIC+ requirements.\n12For any \u03b1 \u2208 A, \u03b1 and \u03b1c are contradictories (i.e. \u2212\u03b1 is \u03b1c and \u2212\u03b1c is \u03b1); and otherwise, s and \u00acs are contradictories (i.e. \u2212s is \u00acs and \u2212\u00acs is s). We need to use contradictories, because otherwise preferences do not play a role, in the sense that undermining attacks (see Appendix B) always succeed as defeats, whatever the preferences. For instance, if in Example 12 \u00ac\u03b1 and \u00ac\u03b2 were contraries, rather than contradictories, of the premises \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively, then the attack B\u2032 A would succeed as a defeat under any argument comparison principle, irrespective of the preference relation over premises.\n27 Imperial College London\nExample 16. Recall the ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) from Example 13. Note that it satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition. The corresponding ASPIC+ framework (L, C,Rs,Kp,6p) is thus closed under contraposition (see Appendix B), and we obtain the following ASPIC+ arguments (similar to those in Example 13, and with the same names, except for X\u2212\u03b1 and X\u2212\u03b5): E = [\u03b5], B = [\u03b2], B \u2032 = [\u03b2 \u2032], A = [\u03b1], X\u2212\u03b5 = [B,B \u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u03b5], EB\u2032 = [E,B\u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u03b2], EB = [E,B \u2192 \u2212\u03b2 \u2032], B = [B \u2192 \u2212\u03b2], B\u2032 = [B\u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u03b2 \u2032], X\u2212\u03b1 = [B,B \u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u03b1], AB\u2032 = [A,B\u2032 \u2192 \u2212\u03b2], AB = [A,B \u2192 \u2212\u03b2 \u2032]. The corresponding AA framework (Args, ) can be represented graphically as follows:\nThis (Args, ) has a unique complete extension \u2205 (which is thus preferred, ideal and\ngrounded, by results in [30, 35]).\nAs in Example 13, since the only preference information is \u03b2 <p \u03b5, it suffices to check only whether attacks on E succeed as defeats. With respect to the Elitist comparison principle, we obtain X\u2212\u03b5 \u227aEli E, so that X\u2212\u03b5 6 \u2192\u0592Eli E,EB,EB \u2032. Therefore, (Args, \u2192\u0592Eli) has a unique complete extension {E} (which is likewise preferred, ideal and grounded) with conclusions (somewhat abusing the notation) Conc({E}) = \u22c3\nA\u2208{E} Conc(A) = {\u03b5}. Note that with respect to the\nDisjoint Elitist comparison principle, we also obtain X\u2212\u03b5 \u227aDEli E, whence (Args, \u2192\u0592DEli) has a unique complete/preferred/ideal/grounded extension {E} too. With respect to the Democratic comparison, X\u2212\u03b5 64Dem E because \u03b2 \u2032 6 p \u03b5, so that \u2192\u0592Dem = , and so (Args, \u2192\u0592Dem) has a unique complete extension \u2205 with Conc(\u2205) = \u2205.\nAs seen in Example 13, (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) has a unique <-complete/<-preferred/ <-ideal/<-grounded extension {\u03b5, \u03b1}, and Cn({\u03b5, \u03b1}) = {\u03b5, \u03b1}. Therefore, under any of the three argument comparison principles, conclusions of the unique extension (under any semantics bar (<-)stable) of the ABA+ framework and its corresponding ASPIC+ framework are\n28 Imperial College London\ndifferent. This happens due to attack reversal in ABA+, which allows {\u03b5} to <-defend both itself and {\u03b1} against {\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032}, because \u03b2 < \u03b5. By contrast, in ASPIC+, the two arguments X\u2212\u03b5 and X\u2212\u03b1 have the same premises {\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032}, but only X\u2212\u03b5 attacks E, while X\u2212\u03b1 attacks A. Hence, although X\u2212\u03b5 E does not result into a defeat due to the preference \u03b2 <p \u03b5, the attack X\u2212\u03b1 A does result into a defeat. In particular, E cannot defend A against the argument X\u2212\u03b1 that has the same premises as the argument X\u2212\u03b5 against which E defends itself.\nTo summarise, it is plain that ABA+ differs conceptually from ASPIC+ in that attacks in ABA+ are reversed due to preference information, while in ASPIC+ attacks are discarded instead. We showed that, as a consequence, even flat ABA+ frameworks satisfying the Axiom of Contraposition can yield semantically different outcomes when mapped into ASPIC+ frameworks (in a natural manner). This complements the results on the contrasting behaviour of the two formalisms: for instance, the desirable ability to unconditionally preserve conflicts in ABA+ (Proposition 7) in contrast to the need to impose certain requirements (such as contraposition) in ASPIC+ (cf. Example 12); also, Weak Contraposition suffices for the Fundamental Lemma 13 to hold in ABA+, whereas ASPIC+ needs (full) contraposition, which is strictly stronger than Weak Contraposition.\nWhether any correspondence is possible under (<-)stable semantics, and whether other mappings from ABA+ to ASPIC+ would allow to establish a correspondence for some restricted class of frameworks, is a line of future research."}, {"heading": "7.4 Dung\u2019s Normal Attack", "text": "[32] proposed a novel attack relation, called normal attack, for ASPIC+-type argumentation formalisms. This notion of normal attack is presented in a simplified setting, where premises (i.e. Kp) are represented as defeasible rules with empty bodies, similar to e.g. [22]. In such a setting, we can attempt to map ABA+ into ASPIC+ as in section 7.3, but with the following change in Definition 7: instead of having premises as assumptions (Kp = A), we have\n\u2022 set of defeasible rules Rd = {\u21d2 \u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 A}, \u2022 an ordering 6d on Rd given by \u21d2 \u03b1 6d \u21d2 \u03b2 iff \u03b1 6 \u03b2, and \u2022 Kp = \u2205 with 6p= \u2205. For our purposes, normal attack can be defined thus.13 Let A,B be (ASPIC+) arguments. A normal-attacks B (at B\u2032), written A N B, iff B \u2032 = [\u21d2 \u03b2] \u2208 Sub(B), Conc(A) = \u2212\u03b2 and \u2204[\u21d2 \u03b1] \u2208 Sub(A) such that \u21d2 \u03b1 <d \u21d2 \u03b2. Dung\u2019s proposal is, given an ASPIC+ framework (L, C,Rs,Rd,6d,Kp,6p), to generate ASPIC + arguments Args and then use directly the normal attack relation N to construct AA frameworks (Args, N) and compute extensions.\n13This is the notion of a normal rebut in [32], sufficient for our purposes. For more general settings, undermining is also included; see [32] for details.\n29 Imperial College London\nWith the change in the mapping from ABA+ to ASPIC+, and using the normal attack described above, we next revisit Example 16 to illustrate the difference between ABA+ and Dung\u2019s approach.\nExample 17. Mapping the ABA+ framework (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) from Example 16 into an ASPIC+ framework as discussed above, we obtain arguments E = [\u21d2 \u03b5], B = [\u21d2 \u03b2], B\u2032 = [\u21d2 \u03b2 \u2032], A = [\u21d2 \u03b1], and otherwise X\u2212\u03b5, EB \u2032, EB, B, B\u2032, X\u2212\u03b1, AB \u2032, AB as in Example 16. The normal attack relation N coincides with the Elitist defeat \u2192\u0592Eli, and so (Args, N) has a unique complete extension {E} with conclusions {\u03b5}. Contrasting with ABA+, which yields {\u03b5, \u03b1} as a unique <-complete extension (see Example 13) with conclusions {\u03b5, \u03b1}, we see the same behaviour in Dung\u2019s approach as that observed in ASPIC+ in Example 16.\nTo summarise, when focusing on the natural map from ABA+ to ASPIC+ as in this section, Dung\u2019s normal attack coincides with the Elitist defeat, wherefore ABA+ differs from Dung\u2019s approach for the same reasons that ABA+ differs from ASPIC+. Whether any correspondence between ABA+ and ASPIC+ with Dung\u2019s normal attack can be established using different mappings is a line of future research."}, {"heading": "7.5 Other Formalisms", "text": "ASPIC\u2212 [22] proposed a simplified version of ASPIC+, called ASPIC\u2212, with a variation of the ASPIC+ attack relation, called unrestricted rebut. In ASPIC\u2212, axioms and premises are omitted and instead represented as strict and defeasible rules, respectively. The new attack relation is based on the idea that while (standard) rebut in ASPIC+ is allowed only on the conclusion of a defeasible rule, unrestricted rebut is allowed on the conclusion of any rule. A major feature of ASPIC\u2212 is that so far it works only with total preference orderings over defeasible rules, and if a partial ordering is used instead, as in ABA+, then the extensions under various semantics need not satisfy the rationality postulates of [21] or other desirable properties, as noted in [22]. (This can also be witnessed by analysing Example 17 using the unrestricted rebut.) It would nonetheless be interesting to investigate in the future the relation of ABA+ and a generalisation of ASPIC\u2212 to deal with partial preference orderings.\nRich PAFs [6] further introduced the so-called Rich PAFs : tuples (Args, ,4,E), where (Args, ,4) is a PAF and E is a refinement relation\u2014a preorder\u2014over extensions of the repaired framework (Args, \u2192\u0592) corresponding to (Args, ,4). Extensions of (Args, ,4,E) are E-maximal extensions of (Args, \u2192\u0592). The authors claim that using suitable refinement relations allows to select the (intuitively) preferable extensions, by excluding other extensions as unacceptable. However, [40] argues that excluding, due to the preferences, some extensions\n30 Imperial College London\nis not a desirable solution, because semantics already provide acceptability conditions. Rather, ranking the extensions may be more appropriate. A discussion on this topic is, however, beyond the scope of this paper. We leave the investigation of how ABA+ relates to Rich PAFs for future work.\nOther Several other approaches to argumentation with preferences, e.g. DeLP [39], an early version of preference-based argumentation frameworks [1], Value-based Argumentation [12, 42], and Deductive Argumentation [14], use preferences to discard attacks from arguments less preferred than the attackees. Similar in spirit are Abstract Dialectical Frameworks [17] (where an attack may fail if the attacked argument has a supporting argument that is preferred over the attacker) as well as AA-based formalisms representing preferences as attacks on attacks (e.g. Extended Argumentation Frameworks [44], Argumentation Frameworks with Recursive Attacks [8]). For reasons similar to those advocated regarding the differences between ABA+ and ASPIC+, those formalisms are different from ABA+ (see also [24]), but precise analysis of any correspondence is left for future research."}, {"heading": "8 Concluding Remarks", "text": "We have presented ABA+, a structured argumentation formalism that conservatively extends Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) with preferences and incorporates a novel technique to reverse attacks due to preference information. One important aspect is that ABA+ assumes preferences on the object level (i.e. over assumptions) and incorporates them directly into the definition of attack, rather than assuming preferences on the meta level (e.g. over arguments). A further important aspect is that ABA+ allows for preferences in generic ABA frameworks, as opposed to allowing for preferences only in flat ABA frameworks [15], as in e.g. [43, 37, 55, 60].\nWe have shown that ABA+ satisfies various desirable properties regarding relationship among semantics (e.g. [15, 35]), rationality postulates (e.g. [21]) and preference handling (e.g. [6, 3, 19, 53]). We plan to investigate further properties of ABA+, as in e.g. [32, 9, 11, 31]. Another important contribution of this paper is a new principle, Weak Contraposition, that relaxes the principle of contraposition used in e.g. ASPIC+ [47] and [32], while guaranteeing various additional desirable properties for ABA+. We plan to investigate which other properties Weak Contraposition guarantees for ABA+ and whether Weak Contraposition can be further relaxed.\nWe have seen that ABA+ generalises Preference-based Argumentation Frameworks (PAFs) [6], improves upon Assumption-Based Argumentation Equipped with Preferences (p ABA) [60] and differs from the majority of formalisms of argumentation with preferences which discard attacks due to preference information (e.g. [1, 12, 42, 17, 14, 39, 22, 32]), particularly ASPIC+ [47]. We aim to analyse more precise relationships of ABA+ to the aforementioned as well as other\n31 Imperial College London\nformalisms of argumentation with preferences (e.g. [8, 22]). In addition, since ABA admits as instances various non-monotonic reasoning formalisms [15], it would be interesting to study the relationship of ABA+ to those formalisms where they have been extended with preferences.\nOther future work directions include: analysing complexity of reasoning problems in ABA+, akin to analysis for ABA in [28, 36]; studying whether computational mechanisms of ABA\u2019s dispute derivations [35, 33, 58] can be adapted to ABA+; relating ABA+ to the version of ABA where sets of arguments are seen as graphs [23]; developing tools for computing ABA+ extensions; extending the analysis in [25] of non-monotonic inference properties for ABA to ABA+; further investigating how ABA+ relates to various preference handling principles for non-monotonic reasoning (e.g. [53, 16]); studying whether and how dynamic preferences (see e.g. [50, 20]) can be accommodated in ABA+.\n32 Imperial College London"}, {"heading": "Appendix A. Proofs", "text": "Theorem 6.\n(i) Let A0 \u2286 A1 \u2286 . . ., where A0 = E, be an \u2286-increasing sequence of <-admissible supersets\nof E. Take its upper bound A = \u22c3\ni>0Ai and note that it is <-admissible: if it were either\nnot closed, not <-conflict-free, or did not <-defend itself, then some finite subset (since deductions are finite) A\u2032 \u2286 A would not be either closed or <-conflict-free, or would not <-defend itself. Now, by Zorn\u2019s Lemma, E has a \u2286-maximally <-admissible superset, i.e. a <-preferred extension containing E.\n(ii) E is by definition closed and <-conflict-free. Given that E < {\u03b2} for every \u03b2 \u2208 A \\E,\nit is clear that E < B for every closed B \u2286 A such that B < E. Hence, E is <- admissible. Moreover, E is \u2286-maximally <-admissible, because E \u222a {\u03b2} < E \u222a {\u03b2} for any \u03b2 \u2208 A \\ E. Thus, E is <-preferred, as required.\n(iii) By (ii) above, E is <-admissible. Suppose for a contradiction that E <-defends A \u2286 A\nbut A * E. Then \u03b1 6\u2208 E for some \u03b1 \u2208 A. Hence, E < {\u03b1}, and so E < A, due to stability. As E <-defends A, we find E < E, which is a contradiction. Thus, by contradiction, E contains every assumption set it <-defends, and so is <-complete.\n(iv) By definition, E is contained in every <-complete extension. By (iii) above, every <-stable\nextension is <-complete. Hence, E is contained in every <-stable extension.\n(v) E is \u2286-maximal set of assumptions contained in every <-preferred extension. Given that\nE is also <-admissible, it is by definition <-ideal.\n(vi) Suppose for a contradiction that B \u2286 A is <-admissible and B < E. By (i) above,\nthere is a <-preferred extension A such that B \u2286 A. Then, as E is <-ideal, we have E \u2286 A, and hence A < A, which is a contradiction.\n(vii) \u2205, being closed, is <-admissible. Hence, by (i) above, there is a <-preferred extension.\nThus, the intersection of <-preferred extensions exists, and so it has a \u2286-maximally <- admissible subset, i.e. an <-ideal extension.\nProposition 9. Let the preference ordering 6 of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) be total and suppose M = {\u03b1 \u2208 A : \u2204\u03b2 \u2208 A with \u03b1 < \u03b2} is closed and <-conflict-free. We first show that M is not <-attacked.\nTo begin with, observe thatM cannot be <-attacked via reverse attack, because its elements are <-maximal in A. So fix \u03b1 \u2208 M and suppose for a contradiction that for some B \u2286 A it holds that B \u22a2R \u03b1 for some R \u2286 R and \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 B \u03b1 6 \u03b2 or \u03b2 \u03b1. Since 6 is total, it follows that \u03b1 6 \u03b2 \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 B. But as \u03b1 is 6-maximal, it must also hold that \u03b2 6 \u03b1, for any \u03b2 \u2208 B. From here, we show that B \u2286 M . Indeed, fix \u03b2 \u2208 B and assume for a contradiction that \u03b2 6\u2208 M . Then \u2203\u03b3 \u2208 A such that \u03b2 < \u03b3. By transitivity of 6, we find \u03b1 < \u03b3, contradicting \u03b1\u2019s 6-maximality. So we must have \u03b2 \u2208 M , and consequently, B \u2286 M . But now, since \u03b1 \u2208 M ,\n33 Imperial College London\nB \u2286 M and B < {\u03b1}, this contradicts <-conflict-freeness of M . Therefore, by contradiction, M is <-unattacked.\nIf (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) admits no <-complete extensions, then the principle is fulfilled trivially. Otherwise, let E be a <-complete extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) and suppose for a contradiction that M * E. Then E does not <-defend M . This means that S < M for some S \u2286 A, which is a contradiction. Hence, by contradiction, M \u2286 E. Thus, (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) fulfils the Principle of Maximal Elements for <-complete semantics.\nSince by Theorem 6(iii) <-stable extensions are <-complete, (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) fulfils the Prin-\nciple of Maximal Elements for <-stable semantics too.\nFinally, for the <-well-founded semantics, recall that, by definition, the <-well-founded extension is the intersection of all the <-complete extensions. It follows that (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) fulfils the Principle of Maximal Elements for <-well-founded semantics too.\nLemma 13 (Fundamental Lemma). We first prove that S \u222a{\u03b1} is <-admissible. If \u03b1 \u2208 S, then S \u222a {\u03b1} is trivially <-admissible. If \u03b1 6\u2208 S, we first show by contradiction that S \u222a {\u03b1} is <-conflict-free, and then that S \u222a {\u03b1} <-defends itself.\nSuppose first that S \u222a {\u03b1} is not <-conflict-free. Then S \u222a {\u03b1} < S \u222a {\u03b1} via either (1) normal or (2) reverse attack. We show that either leads to S < S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} for some S \u2032 \u2286 S, and then that this leads to a contradiction.\n1. Suppose S \u222a{\u03b1} < S \u222a{\u03b1} via normal attack. Note that as S is <-conflict-free and <- defends {\u03b1}, the <-attack S\u222a{\u03b1} < S\u222a{\u03b1} must involve \u03b1. That is, S \u2032\u222a{\u03b1} \u22a2R \u03b2 for some S \u2032 \u2286 S and \u03b2 \u2208 S \u222a {\u03b1}, and \u2200s\u2032 \u2208 S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} we find s\u2032 6< \u03b2. If \u03b2 = \u03b1, then S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} < {\u03b1}, and so S < S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1}. Else, if \u03b2 \u2208 S \u2032, then S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} < S, and so S < S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} too.\n2. Suppose S \u222a {\u03b1} < S \u222a {\u03b1} via reverse attack. As in 1., this <-attack must involve \u03b1, i.e. S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} \u22a2R \u03b2 for some S \u2032 \u2286 S and \u03b2 \u2208 S \u222a {\u03b1}, and \u2203s\u2032 \u2208 S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} such that s\u2032 < \u03b2. Take s\u2032 to be 6-minimal such. If \u03b2 \u2208 S, then S < S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1}. Else, if \u03b2 = \u03b1, then s\u2032 6= \u03b1 (by asymmetry of <), and using the Axiom of Weak Contraposition (WCP henceforth) we find A \u22a2R \u2032 s\u2032 for some A \u2286 (S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1}) \\ {s\u2032}, so that S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} S. Then, by Lemma 4, either S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} < S or S < S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1}, yielding S < S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} in any event.\nIn either case (1) or (2), we obtained S < S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1}, and as S is <-conflict-free and <- defends {\u03b1}, this <-attack must be reverse and involve \u03b1: namely, there is A1 \u222a {\u03b1} \u22a2 R1 s1 with s1 \u2208 S, A1 \u2286 S \u2032, and \u2203s\u20321 \u2208 A1 \u222a {\u03b1} with s \u2032 1 < s1. Take s \u2032 1 to be 6-minimal such. By WCP, there is S1 \u22a2 R\u2032 1 s\u20321 with S1 \u2286 ((A1 \u222a {\u03b1}) \\ {s \u2032 1}) \u222a {s1} and \u2200x \u2208 S1 x 6< s \u2032 1 (by 6-minimality of s\u20321). Note that if s \u2032 1 = \u03b1, then S1 \u2286 A1 \u2286 S, and so S < {\u03b1} via normal attack, which cannot happen, because S is <-conflict-free and <-defends {\u03b1}. Thus, s\u20321 6= \u03b1 and there is S1\u222a{\u03b1} \u22a2 R\u2032 1 s\u20321 with S1 \u2286 (A1 \\{s \u2032 1})\u222a{s1} and \u2200x \u2208 S1 x 6< s \u2032 1 (by 6-minimality of s\u20321). That is, S1 \u222a {\u03b1} < A1, so we find S < S1 \u222a {\u03b1}, again via reverse attack involving\n34 Imperial College London\n\u03b1: A2 \u222a {\u03b1} \u22a2 R2 s2, s2 \u2208 S, A2 \u2286 S1, and \u2203s \u2032 2 \u2208 A2 \u222a {\u03b1} with s \u2032 2 < s2. For 6-minimal such s\u20322, (likewise assuming s \u2032 2 6= \u03b1) by WCP we get S2 \u222a {\u03b1} \u22a2 R\u2032 2 s\u20322 with S2 \u2286 (A2 \\ {s \u2032 2}) \u222a {s2} and \u2200x \u2208 S2 x 6< s \u2032 2.\nAs deductions are finite and < is asymmetric, the procedure described above will eventually exhaust pairs of s\u2032k \u2208 Ak and sk \u2208 Sk such that s \u2032 k < sk, so that S < Sk \u222a {\u03b1} will have to be a normal attack, for some Sk. This leads to a contradiction to S being <-admissible and <-defending {\u03b1}.\nHence, by contradiction, S \u222a {\u03b1} is <-conflict-free. We now want to show that S \u222a {\u03b1} <-defends itself. So let B < S \u222a {\u03b1}. As S is <-admissible and <-defends {\u03b1}, we consider this <-attack to be reverse and involving \u03b1: S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} \u22a2R \u03b21, S \u2032 \u2286 S, \u03b21 \u2208 B, and there is 6-minimal s \u2032 \u2208 S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1} with s\u2032 < \u03b21. Then, by WCP, there is S1 \u22a2 R\u2032 1 s\u2032 with S1 \u2286 ((S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1}) \\ {s\u2032}) \u222a {\u03b21}. Due to <-conflict-freeness of S \u222a {\u03b1}, it holds that \u03b21 \u2208 S1. Also, due to 6-minimality of s \u2032 and because s\u2032 < \u03b21, we find that \u2204x \u2208 S1 with x < s\u2032. Thus, S1 < {s\u2032} via normal attack. Since S is <-admissible and <-defends {\u03b1}, we must have S < S1, and hence S \u222a {\u03b1} < S1. This <-attack cannot be normal on (S \u2032 \u222a {\u03b1}) \\ {s\u2032}, due to <-conflict-freeness of S \u222a {\u03b1}; while, if it is normal on \u03b21, then S \u222a {\u03b1} < B, as required. Else, S \u222a {\u03b1} < S1 via reverse attack: there is B1 \u22a2 R1 s1 with s1 \u2208 S\u222a{\u03b1}, B1 \u2286 S1, and \u2203s \u2032 1 \u2208 B1 with s \u2032 1 < s1 (6-minimal). Due to <-conflict-freeness of S \u222a {\u03b1}, we find \u03b21 \u2208 B1. Then again, by WCP, we find S2 \u22a2 R\u2032 2 s\u20321, S2 \u2286 (B1 \\ {s \u2032 1}) \u222a {s1}, and \u03b21 \u2208 S2. Like with the proof of <-conflict-freeness, this process must terminate with a normal attack S \u222a {\u03b1} < B, so that S \u222a {\u03b1} eventually <-defends itself.\nFinally, we need to show that S \u222a {\u03b1} <-defends {\u03b1\u2032}. Given that S <-defends {\u03b1\u2032} to begin with, and that < is monotonic (Lemma 3), we conclude that S \u222a {\u03b1} <-defends {\u03b1 \u2032} too.\nTheorem 14. Proof of each claim follows the pattern of the corresponding proofs in e.g. [30, 15,"}, {"heading": "35, 8].", "text": "(i) In flat ABA+ frameworks all sets of assumptions are closed, and, in particular, \u2205 is\nclosed. Hence, \u2205 is <-admissible, and so according to Theorem 6(vii), F has a <-preferred extension.14\n(ii) Let E be a <-preferred extension of F and suppose for a contradiction that it is not\n<-complete. Let E <-defend some {\u03b1} \u2286 A \\ E. As E is <-admissible, E \u222a {\u03b1} is <-admissible, by Lemma 13. But then E is not \u2286-maximally <-admissible, contrary to E being <-preferred. Hence, by contradiction, E must be <-complete.\n(iii) Follows from (i) and (ii) above.\n14Note that Weak Contraposition is not needed here, only flatness is required.\n35 Imperial College London\n(iv) Define the <-defence operator Def : \u2118(A) \u2192 \u2118(A) as follows: for A \u2286 A, Def(A) =\n{\u03b1 \u2208 A : A <-defends {\u03b1}}. By Lemma 3, Def is monotonic: if A \u2286 B \u2286 A, then Def(A) \u2286 Def(B). As (\u2118(A),\u2286) is a complete lattice, fixed points of Def also form a complete lattice, according to Knaster-Tarski Theorem [54]. As Def is compact (as deductions are finite), it has a unique least fixed point G, given by G = \u22c3\ni\u2208NDef i(\u2205).\nAs \u2205 is <-admissible, G is also <-admissible, by Lemma 13. Hence, G is <-complete (as G = Def(G)), and unique \u2286-minimal such (as the least fixed point). Therefore, G is a unique <-grounded extension of F , and is <-complete, as required.\n(v) From (i) above, we know that F admits <-preferred extensions, so let S be their intersec-\ntion. If S = \u2205, then it is <-admissible, and so an <-ideal extension (unique). If S 6= \u2205 is <-admissible, then it is an <-ideal extension (unique as well). Else, assume S 6= \u2205 is not <-admissible. Then its \u2286-maximally <-admissible subsets I ( S are <-ideal extensions of F . Suppose I and I \u2032 are two distinct <-admissible subsets of S. Then their union I \u222aI \u2032 is a subset of S too, and so <-conflict-free. By Lemma 13, I \u222aI \u2032 <-defends itself, so must be <-admissible. Consequently, there can be only one \u2286-maximally <-admissible subset of S, i.e. a unique <-ideal extension I of F . Now, suppose for a contradiction that I is not <-complete. Then some {\u03b1} \u2286 A\\ I is <- defended by I. Such \u03b1 must be contained in the intersection S of <-preferred extensions of F , because I \u2286 S <-defends {\u03b1} and every <-preferred extension F is <-complete, by (ii) above. But then, I \u222a {\u03b1} is <-admissible, according to Lemma 13, so that I is not <-ideal\u2014a contradiction. Therefore, I must be <-complete.\nTheorem 17. Suppose first that E \u2286 Args is a \u03c3 extension of (Args, ,4). As E is conflict-free in (Args, \u2192\u0592), it is <-conflict-free in (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6), by Lemma 16. Similarly, using Lemma 16 and construction of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6), it is plain to see that E <-defends itself. So E is <- admissible. It now suffices to prove additional properties as required for each semantics \u03c3. We do this case by case. \u03c3 = complete. If E <-defends A \u2286 A, then, by construction of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6), E <-defends\nevery A \u2208 A, whence E defends every A \u2208 A in (Args, \u2192\u0592). As E is complete, we find A \u2286 E, whence E is <-complete.\n\u03c3 = preferred. If E were not \u2286-maximally <-admissible, it would <-defend some A \u2208 A \\E\n(as for \u03c3 = complete above), whence E would defend A in (Args, \u2192\u0592), and would not be preferred. Hence, E must be <-preferred.\n\u03c3 = stable. If E 6 < {B} for some B \u2208 A \\ E, then E 6 \u2192\u0592 B, by Lemma 16, so that E would\nnot be stable, if E were not <-stable.\n\u03c3 = ideal. As E is contained in every preferred extension P of (Args, ,4), and since pre-\nferred extensions of (Args, ,4) are in one-to-one correspondence with the <-preferred\n36 Imperial College London\nextensions of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6), as per proofs for \u03c3 = preferred above and below, we conclude that E is contained in every <-preferred extension P of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6). Clearly, E must be \u2286-maximal such, as otherwise E would not be ideal in (Args, ,4).\n\u03c3 = grounded. E is \u2286-minimally complete in (Args, \u2192\u0592) [30], and so in (Args, ,4). Thus, E\nis <-complete as above, and due to \u2286-minimality, it is the intersection of all <-complete extensions of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6), so <-grounded. Suppose now that E \u2286 A is a <-\u03c3 extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6). That E is admissible in (Args, ,4) follows from the construction of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) and Lemma 16. For any \u03c3 \u2208 {grounded, ideal, stable, preferred, complete}, a mirror argument as for \u03c3 above applies here, in the case of \u03c3 = grounded noting that, by construction of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6), the <-grounded extension of (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af,6) exists, is unique and <-complete.\nAppendix B. ASPIC+\nFor our purposes in this paper, a simplified exposition of ASPIC+, as follows, will suffice. (The reader is referred to [47, 49, 46] for details.)\nAn ASPIC+ framework is a tuple (L, C,Rs,Rd,6d, n,Kn,Kp,6p), where: \u2022 L is a language; \u2022 C : L \u2192 \u2118(L) is a contrariness function such that:\n\u2013 \u03d5 is a contrary of \u03c8 just in case \u03d5 \u2208 C(\u03c8) and \u03c8 6\u2208 C(\u03d5); \u2013 \u03d5 is a contradictory of \u03c8, denoted \u03d5 = \u2212\u03c8, just in case \u03d5 \u2208 C(\u03c8) and \u03c8 \u2208 C(\u03d5); \u2013 every \u03d5 \u2208 L has at least one contradictory;\n\u2022 Rs is a set of strict rules of the form \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n \u2192 \u03d5, where \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n, \u03d5 \u2208 L; \u2022 Rd is a set of defeasible rules of the form \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n \u21d2 \u03d5, where \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n, \u03d5 \u2208 L; \u2022 Rs \u2229Rd = \u2205; \u2022 6d is a transitive binary relation on Rd; \u2022 n : Rd \u2192 L is a naming function for defeasible rules; \u2022 Kn \u2286 L is a set of axioms ; \u2022 Kp \u2286 L is a set of premises ; \u2022 Kn \u2229 Kp = \u2205; \u2022 6p is a transitive binary relation on Kp. Whenever a component of an ASPIC+ framework is empty, we may omit it. In particular, as we will use neither the naming function n for defeasible rules nor the axioms Kn, these components are henceforth omitted. In the remainder of this section, we assume as given a fixed but otherwise arbitrary ASPIC+ framework (L, C,Rs,Rd,6d,Kp,6p).\nArguments in ASPIC+ are defined as follows. An argument A is any of the following:\n37 Imperial College London\n\u2022 [\u03d5] iff \u03d5 \u2208 Kp. It has:\n\u2013 premises Prem(A) = {\u03d5}; \u2013 conclusion Conc(A) = \u03d5; \u2013 sub-arguments Sub(A) = {A}; \u2013 defeasible rules DefRules(A) = \u2205;\n\u2022 [A1, . . . ,An \u2192 \u03c8] iff A1, . . . ,An are arguments such that there is a strict rule Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An) \u2192\n\u03c8 in Rs. It has:\n\u2013 premises Prem(A) = Prem(A1) \u222a . . . \u222a Prem(An); \u2013 conclusion Conc(A) = \u03c8; \u2013 sub-arguments Sub(A) = Sub(A1) \u222a . . . \u222a Sub(An) \u222a {A}; \u2013 defeasible rules DefRules(A) = DefRules(A1) \u222a . . . \u222a DefRules(An);\n\u2022 [A1, . . . ,An \u21d2 \u03c8] iff A1, . . . ,An are arguments such that there is a defeasible rule Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An) \u21d2\n\u03c8 in Rd. It has:\n\u2013 premises Prem(A) = Prem(A1) \u222a . . . \u222a Prem(An); \u2013 conclusion Conc(A) = \u03c8; \u2013 sub-arguments Sub(A) = Sub(A1) \u222a . . . \u222a Sub(An) \u222a {A}; \u2013 defeasible rules DefRules(A) = DefRules(A1)\u222a. . .\u222aDefRules(An)\u222a{Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An) \u21d2\n\u03c8}.\nThe set of all arguments in (L, C,Rs,Rd,6d,Kp,6p) is henceforth denoted by Args. ASPIC+ frameworks are usually assumed to be closed under contraposition, meaning that for all S \u2286 L, s \u2208 S and \u03d5 \u2208 L it holds that if there is an argument A with Conc(A) = \u03d5, DefRules(A) = \u2205 and Prem(A) \u2286 S, then there must be an argument B with Conc(B) = \u2212s, DefRules(B) = \u2205 and Prem(B) \u2286 (S \\ {s}) \u222a {\u2212\u03d5}. For our purposes, when mapping ABA+ frameworks into ASPIC+ (see section 7.3) this is equivalent to assuming that (L,R,A,\u0304\u00af ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition (Axiom 4 in section 5). Other requirements on ASPIC+ frameworks will be met automatically in our setting, so we omit to specify them here.\nAttacks in ASPIC+ are defined as follows.15 Let A,B \u2208 Args. We say that A attacks B (on B \u2032), written A B, iff for some B\u2032 \u2208 Sub(B) such that B\u2032 = [\u03d5] and \u03d5 \u2208 Kp, Conc(A) = \u2212\u03d5 (i.e. Conc(A) \u2208 C(\u03d5) and \u03d5 \u2208 C(Conc(A))).\nArguments can be compared using the given preference ordering 6p over premises Kp, as\nfollows. Consider A,B \u2208 Args with A = Prem(A) \u2229 Kp and B = Prem(B) \u2229 Kp.\n\u2022 A \u227aEli B if \u2203\u03b1 \u2208 A such that \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 B we find \u03b1 <p \u03b2; \u2022 A \u227aDEli B if \u2203\u03b1 \u2208 A \\B such that \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 B \\ A we find \u03b1 <p \u03b2; \u2022 A 4Dem B if \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 A we find \u03b2 \u2208 B with \u03b1 6p \u03b2;\n15When mapping ABA+ frameworks into ASPIC+, due to absence of defeasible rules, only undermining attacks will result, so we omit to specify the other types of attacks.\n38 Imperial College London\n\u2022 A \u227aDem B if A 4Dem B and B 64Dem A. The three comparison principles Eli, Dem and DEli are referred to as Elitist, Democratic\nand Disjoint Elitist [61], respectively.\nASPIC+ attacks succeed as defeats whenever the attacking argument is not less preferred than the (sub-)argument attacked, as follows. Let A,B \u2208 Args and fix \u227a\u2208 {\u227aEli,\u227aDEli,\u227aDem}. We say that A defeats B, written A \u2192\u0592 B, iff A B on B\u2032 and A \u2280 B\u2032. We may write e.g. \u2192\u0592Eli to denote the defeat with respect to (in this case) the Elitist comparison \u227aEli of arguments.\nFinally, ASPIC+ semantics are defined via the AA frameworks of arguments and defeats among them. More precisely, given F = (L, C,Rs,Rd,6d,Kp,6p), the corresponding AA framework is (Args, \u2192\u0592), where \u2192\u0592 is the defeat relation generated by and \u227a. Extensions of F (under various semantics \u03c3) are defined as \u03c3 extensions of (Args, \u2192\u0592) (see section 2).\n39 Imperial College London"}], "references": [{"title": "A Reasoning Model
