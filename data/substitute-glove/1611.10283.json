In this case, humans would usually prefer Arm 1 over Arm 2. The human preferences get flipped if we change to costs, i.e., Arm 1 loses a million with a very low probability of 1/106, while Arm 2 loses $1000 w.p. 1/103. In this case, Arm 2 is preferred over Arm 1. The above example illustrates that traditional expected value falls short in explaining human preferences, and the reader is referred to the classic Allais problem Allais [1953] that rigorously argues against expected utility theory as a model for human-based decision making systems.\nViolations of the expected value-based preferences in human-based decision making systems can be alleviated by incorporating distortions in the underlying probabilities of the system Starmer [2000] [Quiggin, 2012, Chapter 4]. Probabilistic distortions have a long history in behavioral science and economics, and we bring this idea to a multi-armed bandit setup. In particular, we base our approach on rank-dependent expected utility (RDEU) Quiggin [2012], which includes the popular cumulative prospect theory (CPT) of Tversky and Kahneman Tversky and Kahneman [1992]. \u2217aditya@ece.iisc.ernet.in \u2020prashla@umd.edu \u2021mfu@isr.umd.edu \u00a7marcus@umd.edu\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n10 28\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n0 N\nThe distortions happen via a weight function w : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] that transforms probabilities in a nonlinear fashion. As illustrated in Figure 1, a typical weight function, say w : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1], has the inverted-S shape. In other words, w inflates low probabilities and deflates large probabilities and can explain human preferences well. For instance, in the example above, if we choose w(1/106) > 1/106 and take expectations w.r.t. the w-distorted distribution, then Arm 1 would be preferable when the problem is setup with rewards and Arm 2 for the problem with costs. The suitability of this approach, esp. with a inverted-S shaped weight function, to model human decision making (and thus preferences) has been widely documented Prelec [1998], Wu and Gonzalez [1996], Conlisk [1989], Camerer [1989, 1992], Cherny and Madan [2009], Gonzalez and Wu [1999].\nWe use a traveler\u2019s route choice as a running example to illustrate the main ideas in this paper. The setting here is that a human travels from a source (e.g., home) to a destination (e.g., office), both fixed, every day. He/she has multiple routes to choose from, and each route incurs a stochastic delay with unknown distributions. The problem then is to choose a route that minimizes some function of delay. Using expected delay may not lead to a routing choice that is appealing to the human traveler. In addition to the examples mentioned earlier, intuitively humans would prefer a route with a slight excess of delay over another that has a small probability of getting into a traffic jam that takes hours to be resolved. The requirement here is for an automated routing algorithm, say one that sits as an application on the traveler\u2019s mobile device, that learns the best route for the traveler. The algorithm is online and uses the delay information for a recommended route as feedback to find the best route. We treat this problem in two regimes: first, a setting where the number of routes is small, so the traveler can afford to try each of the routes a small number of times before fixing on the \u201cbest\u201d route; second, a big road network setting that involves a large number of routes, which prohibits an approach that requires trying the bulk of the routes before deciding which is the \u201cbest\u201d.\nWe formalize two probabilistically distorted bandit settings that correspond to the two routing setups mentioned above. The first is the classic K-armed setting, while the second is the linear bandit setting. In both settings, we define the weight-distorted value \u00b5x for any arm x in the space of arms X as follows:\n\u00b5x= \u222b \u221e 0 w(P [Yx > z])dz\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 w(P [\u2212Yx > z])dz, (1)\nwhere w is the weight function that satisfies w(0) = 0 and w(1) = 1 and Yx is the random variable (r.v.) corresponding to the stochastic rewards from arm x \u2208 X . By choosing the identity weight function w(p) = p, we obtain \u00b5x = E(Y+x ) \u2212 E(Y\u2212x ) = E(Yx), where y+ = max(y, 0) and y\u2212 = max(\u2212y, 0) denote the positive and negative parts of y \u2208 R, respectively. Thus, \u00b5x as in (1) generalizes standard expected value. As discussed earlier, w has to be chosen in a non-linear fashion, to capture human preferences, which has strong empirical support.\nIn our setting, the goal is find an arm x\u2217 that maximizes (1). The problem is challenging because the current bandit solutions, for instance, the popular UCB algorithm, cannot handle distortions. This is because the environment provides samples from the distribution Fx when arm x is pulled, while the integral in (1) involves a distorted distribution. The implication is that a simple sample mean and a confidence term suggested by the Hoeffding\ninequality is enough to derive the UCB values for any arm in the regular setting involving expected values. On the other hand, one requires a good enough estimate of Fx to estimate \u00b5x. Just for the sake of example, a (\u03b1-Ho\u0308lder continuous) weight function such as w(t) := t\u03b1, when applied to a Bernoulli(p) distribution, distorts the mean to p\u03b1 from p, and can introduce an arbitrarily large scaling for arms with real expectations close to 0. It follows that nonlinear weight distortion can, in fact, change the order of the optimal arm, resulting in a distortion-unaware algorithm like UCB converging to the wrong arm and incurring linear regret. The W-UCB algorithm that we propose incorporates a empirical distribution-based approach, similar to that of Prashanth et al. [2016], to estimate \u00b5x. However, unlike the latter, our algorithm incorporates a confidence term relying on the Dvoretzky-KieferWolfowitz (DKW) inequality [Wasserman, 2015] that ensures the W-UCB values are a high-probability bound on the true value \u00b5x. We provide upper bounds on the regret of W-UCB, assuming w is Ho\u0308lder continuous and provide empirical demonstrations on a setting from [Tversky and Kahneman, 1992].\nNext, we consider a linear bandit setting with weight distortions that can be motivated as follows: Consider a network graph G = (V,E), |E| = d, with a source s \u2208 V and destination t \u2208 V . The interaction proceeds over multiple rounds, where in each round m, the user picks a route xm from s to t (a route is a collection of edges encoded by a vector of 0\u22121 values in d dimensions) and experiences a stochastic delay xTm (\u03b8 +Nm). Here \u03b8 \u2208 Rd is an underlying model parameter and Nm \u2208 Rd is a random noise vector, both unknown to the learner. The physical interpretation is that the nodes represent geographical locations (say junctions) and the edges are roads that connect nodes. An edge from i to j will have an edge weight \u03b8ij , which quantifies the delay for this edge.\nNotice that the observations include a noise component that scales with the route chosen \u2013 this is unlike the model followed in earlier linear bandit works [Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011, Dani et al., 2008], where the noise was independent of the arm chosen. Our noise model makes practical sense because the observed delay in a road traffic network depends on the length of the route, for e.g., one would expect more noise in a detour involving ten roads than in a direct one-road route. The aim is to find a low-delay route that satisfies the user. The setting is such that the number of routes is large (so the regular K-armed bandits don\u2019t scale) and one needs to utilize the linearity in the costs (delays) to find the optimal route, where optimality is qualified in terms of a weight-distorted expectation.\nFor the linear bandit setting, we propose a variant of the OFUL algorithm [Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011], that incorporates weight-distorted values in the arm selection step. The regret analysis of the resulting WOFUL algorithm poses novel challenges compared to that in the linear bandit problem, primarily because the instantaneous cost (and hence regret) at each round is in fact a nonlinear function of the features of the played arm. This occurs due to the distortion in expectation caused by the weight function, although the actual observation (e.g., network delay in the example above) is linear in expectation over the played arm\u2019s features. The weight function can not only change the optimal arm but can also potentially amplify small differences in real expected values of arms to much larger values, leading to a blowing up of overall regret. However, our analysis shows that regret in weightdistorted cost as the performance metric can be controlled at the same rate as that in standard linear bandit models, irrespective of the structure of the distortion function. More specifically, we show, using a careful analysis of the effect of weight distortion, that the regret of the WOFUL algorithm is no more than O (d \u221a n polylog(n)) in n rounds with high probability, similar to the guarantee enjoyed by the OFUL algorithm in linear bandits (note however that the identity of the optimal arm may be different due to weight distortion in costs).\nRelated work The closest related previous contribution is that of Prashanth et al. [2016], where the authors bring in ideas from CPT to a reinforcement learning (RL) setting. In contrast, we formulate two multi-armed bandit models that incorporate weight-distortions. From a theoretical standpoint, we handle the exploration-exploitation tradeoff via UCB-inspired algorithms, while the focus of Prashanth et al. [2016] was to devise a policy-gradient scheme given biased estimates of a certain CPT-value defined for each policy. Moreover, we provide finite-time regret bounds for both bandit settings, while the guarantees for the policy gradient algorithm of Prashanth et al. [2016] are asymptotic in nature.\nPrevious works involving RDEU and CPT are huge in number; at a conceptual level, the work in this paper integrates machine learning (esp. bandit learning) with an RDEU approach that involves a probabilistic distortions\nvia a weight function. To the best of our knowledge, RDEU/CPT papers in the literature assume model information, i.e., a setting where the distributions of the arms are known, while we have a model-free setting where one can only obtain sample values from the arms\u2019 distributions. Our setting makes practical sense; for instance, in the traveler\u2019s route choice problem one can only obtain sample delays for a particular route, while the distribution governing the delays for any route is not known explicitly.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we formalize the K-armed bandit problem with weight distortions and present the W-UCB algorithm. Next, in Section 3, we formulate the linear bandit problem with arm-dependent noise model and present the WOFUL algorithm. In Section 4, we provide the proofs of the regret bounds for W-UCB as well as WOFUL algorithms. In Section 5, we present simulation experiments on a synthetic setup and a traffic routing application, respectively. Finally, in Section 6 we provide the concluding remarks.\n2 K-armed bandit with weight distortion Suppose there are K arms with unknown distributions Fk, k = 1, . . . ,K. In each round m = 1, . . . , n, the algorithm pulls an arm Im \u2208 {1, . . . ,K} and obtains a sample cost from the distribution FIm of arm Im.\nThe classic objective is to play (or pull) the arm whose expected cost is the least. In this paper, we take a different approach inspired by non-expected utility (EU) approaches and use the weight distorted-cost \u00b5k as the performance criterion for any arm k. The latter quantity, defined in (1), can be seen to be equivalent to the following:\n\u00b5k := \u222b \u221e 0 w(1\u2212 Fk(z))dz \u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 w(Fk(\u2212z))dz, (2)\nwhere w : [0, 1]\u2192 [0, 1] is a weight function that distorts probabilities. The optimal arm is one that minimizes the weight-distorted cost, i.e., \u00b5\u2217 = mink \u00b5k. The optimal arm is not necessarily unique, i.e., there may exist multiple arms with the optimal weight-distorted cost \u00b5\u2217. With the above notion of weight-distorted cost, we define the cumulative regretRn asRn = \u2211K k=1 Tk(n)\u00b5k \u2212\nn\u00b5\u2217, where Tk(n) = \u2211n m=1 I(Im = k) is the number of times arm k is pulled up to time n. The expected regret\ncan be written as ERn = \u2211K k=1 E[Tk(n)]\u2206k, where \u2206k = \u00b5k \u2212 \u00b5\u2217 denotes the gap between the weight-distorted costs of the optimal arm and of arm k. Note that this definition of regret arises from the interpretation that each arm k is associated with a deterministic value \u00b5k. The least possible cumulative cost that can be suffered in n rounds is thus n\u00b5\u2217, while that suffered by a given strategy is \u2211K k=1 Tk(n)\u00b5k. Thus, the regret as defined above is a measure of the rate at which a strategy converges to playing the optimal arm in the sense of weighted or distorted cost. We remark that the regret performance measure, as defined above, is explicitly defined within a stochastic model for rewards. Thus, low-regret algorithms designed for the nonstochastic setting, e.g., EXP3 [Auer et al., 2003], are not inherently suitable for this problem, as they do not factor in the distortion caused in (expected) reward. A similar observation holds for conventional stochastic bandit algorithms such as UCB, and algorithms sensitive to arm reward variances such as UCB-V [Audibert et al., 2009] \u2013 once weight distortion is incorporated, the algorithm will converge to an arm that is not weight-distorted value optimal. Thus, applying a variance-sensitive algorithm (like UCB-V) will still yield linear regret in the distorted setting."}, {"heading": "2.1 W-UCB Algorithm", "text": "Estimating the weight-distorted cost for any arm k is challenging, and one cannot use a Monte Carlo approach with sample means because weight-distorted cost involves a distorted distribution, whereas the samples come from the undistorted distribution Fk. Thus, one needs to estimate the entire distribution, and for this purpose, we adapt the quantile-based approach of [Prashanth et al., 2016].\nEstimating \u00b5k: At time instant m, let Yk,1, . . . , Yk,l denote the samples from the cost distribution Fk for arm k, where we have used l to denote the number of samples Tk(m\u2212 1) for notational convenience. Order the samples\nin ascending fashion as Y[k,1] \u2264 Y[k,2] \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Y[k,lb] \u2264 0 \u2264 Y[k,lb+1] \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Y[k,l], where lb \u2208 {0, 1, 2, . . . , l} denotes the index of a \u2018boundary\u2019 sample after which a sign change occurs. The first integral in (2) is estimated by the quantity\n\u00b5\u0302+k,l := l\u2211 i=lb+1 Y[k,i] ( w ( l + 1\u2212 i l ) \u2212w ( l \u2212 i l )) , (3)\nwhile the second integral in (2) is estimated by the quantity\n\u00b5\u0302\u2212k,l := lb\u2211 i=1 Y[k,i] ( w ( i\u2212 1 l ) \u2212 w ( i l )) . (4)\nWe finally estimate \u00b5k as follows:\n\u00b5\u0302k,l = \u00b5\u0302 + k,l \u2212 \u00b5\u0302 \u2212 k,l. (5)\nFrom (2) and (5) above, it can be seen that \u00b5\u0302k,l is the weight-distorted cost of the empirical distribution of samples from arm k seen thus far, i.e.,\n\u00b5\u0302k,l := \u222b \u221e 0 w(1\u2212 F\u0302k,l(z))dz \u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 w(F\u0302k,l(\u2212z))dz,\nwhere F\u0302k,l(x) := 1l \u2211l i=1 I[Yk,i\u2264x] denotes the empirical distribution of r.v. Yx. In particular, the first and second integral above correspond to (3) and (4), respectively. We next provide a sample complexity result for the accuracy of the estimator \u00b5\u0302k,l under the following assumptions: (A1) The weight function w is Ho\u0308lder continuous with constant L and exponent \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1]: supx 6=y |w(x)\u2212w(y)| |x\u2212y|\u03b1 \u2264 L. (A2) The arms\u2019 costs are bounded by M > 0 almost surely.\n(A1) is necessary to ensure that the weight-distorted value \u00b5k, k = 1, . . . ,K is finite. Moreover, the popular choice for the weight function, proposed by Tversky and Kahneman [1992] and illustrated in Figure 1, is Ho\u0308lder continuous.\nTheorem 1 (Sample complexity of estimating distorted cost). Assume (A1)-(A2). Then, for any > 0 and any k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K}, we have P (|\u00b5\u0302k,m \u2212 \u00b5k| > ) \u2264 2 exp ( \u22122m( /LM)2/\u03b1 ) .\nFor the special case of Lipschitz weight functions w, setting \u03b1 = 1 in the above theorem, we obtain a sample complexity of order O ( 1/ 2 ) for accuracy .\nProof. See Section 4.1.1.\nB-values (weighted UCB values): At instantm, define the B-value for any arm k, as a function of the number of samples l and constants \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], L > 0,M > 0, as: Bm,l(k) = \u00b5\u0302k,l\u2212 \u03b3m,l, where \u03b3m,l := LM ( 3 logm\n2l\n)\u03b1 2\n.\nThe r.v. \u00b5\u0302k,l, defined by (5), is an estimate of \u00b5k that uses the l = Tk(m\u22121) sample costs of arm k seen so far and \u03b3m,l is the confidence width, which together with \u00b5\u0302m,l ensures that the true weight-distorted value \u00b5k lies within [\u00b5\u0302k,l \u2212 \u03b3m,l, \u00b5\u0302k,l + \u03b3m,l] with high probability, i.e., for k = 1, . . . ,K, both P (\u00b5\u0302k,l + \u03b3m,l \u2264 \u00b5k) \u2264 2m\u22123 and P (\u00b5\u0302k,l \u2212 \u03b3m,l \u2265 \u00b5k) \u2264 2m\u22123.\nUsing the B-values defined above, the W-UCB algorithm chooses the arm Im at instant m as follows:\nIf m \u2264 K, then play Im = m (initial round-robin phase), Else, play Im = arg min\nk={1,...,K} Bm,Tk(m\u22121)(k).

On the other hand, when \u03b1 < 1, the regret bounds are weaker than O( \u221a n).\nThe following result shows that one cannot hope to obtain better regret than that of W-UCB (Theorem 2) over the class of Ho\u0308lder-continuous weight functions, i.e., weight functions satisfying (A1)-(A2), by exhibiting a matching lower bound.\nTheorem 3 (Regret lower bound). For any learning algorithm with sub-polynomial regret in the time horizon, there exists (1) a weight function which is monotone increasing and \u03b1-Ho\u0308lder continuous with constant L, and (2) a set of cost distributions for the arms with support bounded by M , for which the algorithm\u2019s regret satisfies\nE [Rn] = \u2126 (\u2211 {k:\u2206k>0} (LM)2/\u03b1 log n\n4\u2206 2/\u03b1\u22121 k\n) .\nWe defer a more precise statement of the above result to Section 4.1.4.\nRemark 2. (CPT adaptation) As remarked in the introduction, a popular approach using a weight function to distort probabilities is the so-called cumulative prospect theory (CPT) [Tversky and Kahneman, 1992]. In addition to the weight function, a salient feature of CPT is to employ different utility functions, say u+ and u\u2212, to handle gains and losses, respectively. The B-values and the theoretical guarantees can be easily extended to incorporate CPT-style utility functions, and the reader is referred to Section 4.1.5 for details."}, {"heading": "3 Linearly parameterized bandit with weight distortion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Arm-dependent noise setting", "text": "The setting here involves arms that are given as the compact set X \u2282 Rd (each element of X is interpreted as a vector of features associated with an arm).

ConfidenceBall in [Dani et al., 2008] or OFUL in [Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011]), but deviates in the step when an arm is chosen. In particular, in any round m of the algorithm, WOFUL uses \u00b5x(\u03b8) as the decision criterion for any arm x \u2208 X and \u03b8 \u2208 Cm, where \u00b5x(\u03b8) is the weight-distorted value that is defined in (8) and Cm is the confidence ellipsoid that is specified in Algorithm 1. This is unlike regular linear bandit algorithms, which use xT\u03b8 as the cost for any arm x \u2208 X and \u03b8 \u2208 Cm. Note that the \u201cin-parameter\u201d or arm-dependent noise model (7) also necessitates modifying the standard confidence ellipsoid construction of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. [2011] by rescaling with the arm size (the Am and bm variables in Algorithm 1). For a positive semidefinite matrix M and a vector x, we use the notation \u2016x\u2016M = \u221a xTMx to denote the Euclidean norm of x weighted by M .\nRemark 3. (Computation cost) The computationally intensive step in WOFUL is the optimization of the weightdistorted value over an ellipsoid in the parameter space (the third line in the for loop). This can be explicitly solved as follows. For a fixed x \u2208 X , we can let \u03b8\u0304m,x := arg min\n\u03b8\u2032\u2208Cm \u00b5x(\u03b8 \u2032) = arg min \u03b8\u2032\u2208Cm xT\u03b8\u2032 = \u03b8\u0302m\u2212DmA\u22121m x/ \u2016x\u2016A\u22121 This\nis because the weight-distorted value is monotone under translation (see Lemma 5 below). The cost-minimizing arm is thus computed as xm = arg min{\u00b5x1(\u03b8\u0304m,1), . . . , \u00b5x|X|(\u03b8\u0304m,|X |)}."}, {"heading": "3.3 Main results", "text": "Theorem 4 (Regret bound for WOFUL).

For the identity weight function w(t) = t, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 with L = \u03b1 = 1, we recover the stochastic linear bandit setting, and the associated O\u0303 (d \u221a n) regret bound for linear bandit algorithms such as ConfidenceBall1 and ConfidenceBall2 [Dani et al., 2008], OFUL [Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011]. Hence, the result above is a generalization of regret bounds for standard linear bandit optimization to the case where a non-linear weight function of the cost distribution is to be optimized from linearly parameterized observations. The distortion of the cost distribution via a weight function, rather interestingly, does not impact the order of the bound on problemindependent regret, and we obtain O\u0303 (d \u221a n) here as well.\nRemark 6. Note that the weight function w can be any non-linear function bounded in [0, 1]; unlike the K-armed setting, we do not impose a Ho\u0308lder continuity assumption on w. Remark 7. A lower bound of essentially the same order as Theorem 4 (O(d \u221a n)) holds for regret in (undistorted) linear bandits [Dani et al., 2007]. One can show a similar lower bound argument with distortions, implying that the result of the theorem is not improvable (order-wise) across weight functions.\nRemark 8. (Linear bandits with arm-independent additive noise) An alternative to modelling \u201cin-parameter\u201d or arm-dependent noise (7) is to have independent additive noise, i.e., cm := xTm\u03b8 + \u03b7m. This is a standard model of stochastic observations adopted in the linear bandit literature [Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011, Dani et al., 2008]. The key difference here is that, unlike the setting in (7), the noise component \u03b7m does not depend on the arm played xm. In this case, Lemma 5 below shows that \u00b5X+a \u2265 \u00b5X , i.e., the distorted CPT value \u00b5 preserves order under translations of random variables. As a consequence of this fact, the WOFUL algorithm reduces to the OFUL algorithm in the standard linear bandit setting with arm-independent noise.\nProof sketch for Theorem 4. We upper-bound the instantaneous regret rm as follows: Letting x\u0302m = xm\u2016xm\u2016 and N to be a standard Gaussian r.v. in d dimensions, we have\nrm = \u00b5xm(\u03b8)\u2212 \u00b5x\u2217(\u03b8) \u2264 \u00b5xm(\u03b8)\u2212 \u00b5xm(\u03b8\u0303m) = \u2016xm\u2016 ( \u00b5W+x\u0302Tm\u03b8 \u2212 \u00b5W+x\u0302Tm\u03b8\u0303m ) (9)\n\u2264 2 \u2016xm\u2016 \u2223\u2223\u2223x\u0302Tm(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303m)\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (10)\nand the rest of the proof uses the standard confidence ellipsoid result that ensures \u03b8 resides in Cm with high probability. A crucial observation necessary to ensure (9) is that, for any r.v. X and any a \u2208 R, the difference in weight-distorted cost \u00b5X+a\u2212\u00b5X is a non-linear function of a (see Lemma 5 below). Thus, it is not straightforward to compute the weight-distorted cost after translation and this poses a significant challenge in the analysis of WOFUL for the arm-dependent noise model that we consider here.\nLemma 5. Let \u00b5X := \u222b\u221e 0 w(P [X > z])dz \u2212 \u222b\u221e 0 w(P [\u2212X > z])dz. Then, for any a \u2208 R, we have \u00b5X+a =\n\u00b5X + \u222b 0 \u2212a [w(P [X > u]) + w(P [X < u])] du. Consequently, since w is bounded by 1, we have |\u00b5X+a \u2212 \u00b5X | \u2264 2|a|, for any a \u2208 R.\nThe reader is referred to Section 4.2 for the detailed proof.\n1O\u0303(\u00b7) is a variant of the O(\u00b7) that ignores log-factors."}, {"heading": "4 Convergence proofs", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Proofs for K-armed bandit", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Proof of Theorem 1", "text": "The proof is very similar to that of Proposition 2 in [Prashanth et al., 2016].

We first show the result for costs bounded by M = 1, the extension to general M follows. The key ingredient in the proof is the seminal lower-bound on the number of suboptimal arm plays derived by Lai and Robbins [1985]. Their result shows that for any algorithm that plays suboptimal arms only a subpolynomial number of times in the time horizon,\nlim inf n\u2192\u221e E [Tk(n)] log n \u2265 1 D(Fk||Fk\u2217)\nfor any suboptimal arm k, where k\u2217 denotes the optimal arm. (Note that the argument at its core uses only a changeof-measure idea and the sub-polynomial regret hypothesis, and is thus unaffected by the fact that we measure regret by distorted, i.e., non-expected, costs.)\nUsing this along with the definition of regret, we get\nlim inf n\u2192\u221e E [Rn] log n = lim inf n\u2192\u221e\n\u2211 {k:\u2206k>0} E[Tk(n)]\u2206k\nlog n \u2265 \u2211\n{k:\u2206k>0}\n\u2206k \u00b7 lim inf n\u2192\u221e E[Tk(n)] log n\n\u2265 \u2211\n{k:\u2206k>0}\n\u2206k D(Fk||Fk\u2217)\n= \u2211\n{k:\u2206k>0}\n(2LM)2/\u03b1\n\u2206 2/\u03b1\u22121 k\n\u00b7 (\u2206k/2LM) 2/\u03b1\nD(Fk||Fk\u2217) .

In fact, we will show that it enough to design Bernoulli distributions for the arms\u2019 costs, i.e., arm k\u2019s cost is Ber(pk), or equivalently, Fk(x) = (1 \u2212 pk)1[0,1)(x) + 1[1,\u221e)(x). This gives a simple expression for the weightdistorted cost of any arm k as \u00b5k = \u222b 1 0 w(pk)dz = w(pk), and, consequently, \u2206k = w(pk) \u2212 w(pk\u2217), for any weight function w : [0, 1]\u2192 [0, 1] with w(0) = w(1)\u2212 1 = 0. Consider now a weight function w : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] which is monotone increasing from 0 to 1, Ho\u0308lder continuous with any desired constant L > 0 and exponent \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], and, moreover, satisfies the following \u201cHo\u0308lder continuity property from below\u201d: for some p\u0303 \u2208 (0, 1) (say, p\u0303 = 1/2), |w(p)\u2212 w(p\u0303)| \u2265 L|p\u2212 p\u0303|\u03b1. Such a weight function can always be constructed, e.g., for \u03b1 = 1/2, L = 1, take the function w(x) = 12 \u2212 1\u221a 2 \u221a 1 2 \u2212 x for\nx \u2208 [0, 1/2], and w(x) = 12 + 1\u221a 2 \u221a x\u2212 12 for x \u2208 (1/2, 1]. (This is essentially formed by gluing together two inverted and scaled copies of the function \u221a x, to make an S-shaped function infinitely steep at x = 1/2.)\nFor such a weight function, putting pk\u2217 = p\u0303 = 1/2 and pk > pk\u2217 , k 6= k\u2217, we can use the standard bound2\nD(Fk||Fk\u2217) = pk log pk pk\u2217 + (1\u2212 pk) log 1\u2212 pk 1\u2212 pk\u2217\n\u2264 (pk \u2212 pk \u2217)2\npk\u2217(1\u2212 pk\u2217) = 4(pk \u2212 pk\u2217)2\n\u2264 4 ( w(pk)\u2212 w(pk\u2217)\nL\n)2/\u03b1 (by the \u201clower-Ho\u0308lder \u201d property of w)\n= 4 ( \u2206k L )2/\u03b1 .\nSince M = 1 for the Bernoulli family of cost distributions, this implies, together with (18), that\nlim inf n\u2192\u221e E [Rn] log n\n\u2265 \u2211\n{k:\u2206k>0}\nL2/\u03b1\n4\u2206 2/\u03b1\u22121 k\n.\nFor general M , one can modify this construction and consider arms\u2019 cost distributions to be Bernoulli scaled by the constant M (i.e., equal to M with probability p and 0 otherwise).

The proof is a consequence of Theorem 2 in [Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011].

It relates the weight-distorted value \u00b5x(\u03b8) of the stochastic cost from an arm x \u2208 X to the weight-distorted value of a translated standard normal distribution.\nLemma 8 (Weight-distorted value under scaling). If Z denotes a standard normal random variable, then for any arm x and \u03b8,\n\u00b5x(\u03b8) = \u2016x\u2016 \u00b7 \u00b5Z+ xT\u03b8\u2016x\u2016 ,\nwhere \u00b5Y denotes the weight-distorted value of a random variable Y .\nProof. Let X denote the stochastic cost from arm x with \u03b8 as the parameter; we have that X is normal with mean xT\u03b8 and variance \u2016x\u20162.

The claim follows."}, {"heading": "5 Numerical Experiments", "text": "We describe two sets of experiments pertaining to K-armed and linear bandit settings, respectively. For both problems, we take the S-shaped weight function w(p) = p \u03b7\n(p\u03b7+(1\u2212p)\u03b7)1/\u03b7 , with \u03b7 = 0.61, to model perceived distortions in cost. Tversky and Kahneman observe that this distortion weight function is a good fit to explain distorted value preferences among human beings.\n5.1 Experiments for K-armed Bandit We study two stylized 2-armed bandit problems which, in part, draw upon experiments carried out by Tversky and Kahneman [1992] on human subjects in their studies of non-EU cumulative prospect theory. Figures 2 (a) and (b) describe each problem setting in detail (following the convention of this paper of modeling costs, \u201d$x w.p. p\u201d is taken to mean a loss of $x suffered with a probability of p.)\nFor the first problem, the weight function w gives the distorted cost of arm 1 as $10.55, much higher than its expected cost of $5 and thus more expensive due to the deterministic Arm 2 with a (distorted and expected) cost of $7. The distortion in costs thus shifts the optimal arm from Arm 1 to Arm 2, and an online learning algorithm must be aware of this effect in order to attain low regret with respect to choosing Arm 2. A similar pattern is true for the other problem involving truly stochastic arms \u2013 weight distortion favors the arm with the higher cost in true expectation.\nWe benchmark the cumulative regret of two algorithms \u2013 (a) the well-known UCB algorithm [Auer et al., 2002], and (b) W-UCB; the results are as in Figure 2. In the experiments, UCB is not aware of the distorted weighting and hence attains linear regret with respect to playing the optimal distorted arm, due to converging to essentially a \u2018wrong\u2019 arm. On the other hand, the W-UCB algorithm, being designed to explicitly account for distorted cost perception, estimates the distortion using sample-based quantiles and exhibits significantly lower regret."}, {"heading": "5.2 Experiments for Linear Bandit", "text": "We study the problem of optimizing the route choice of a human traveler using Green light district (GLD) traffic simulation software Wiering et al. [2004]. In this setup, a source-destination pair is fixed in a given road network. Learning proceeds in an online fashion, where the algorithm chooses a route in each round and the system provides the (stochastic) delay for the chosen route. The objective is to find the \u201cbest\u201d path that optimizes some function of delay, while not exploring too much. While traditional algorithms minimized the expected delay, in this work, we consider the distorted value (as defined in (8)) as the performance metric.\nWe implement both OFUL and WOFUL algorithms for this problem. Since the weight functionw is non-linear, a closed form expression for \u00b5x(\u03b8\u0302m) is not available and we employ the empirical distribution scheme, described for the K-armed bandit setting (see (5)), for estimating the weight-distorted value. For this purpose, we simulate 25000 samples of the Gaussian distribution, as defined in (7).\nFor computing a performance benchmark to evaluate OFUL/WOFUL, we perform an experiment to learn a linear (additive) relationship between the delay of a route and the delays along each of its component lanes. This is reasonable considering the fact the individual delays along each lane stablize when the traffic network reaches steady state and the delay incurred along any route x would be centered around xT\u03b8. For learning the linear relationship, we simulate 100000 steps of the traffic simulator to collect the delays along any route of the source-destination pair. Using these samples, we perform ridge regression to obtain \u03b8\u0302off, i.e., we solve\n\u03b8\u0302off = arg min \u03b8\n1\n2 \u03c4\u2211 i=1 (ci \u2212 \u03b8Txi)2 + \u03bb \u2016\u03b8\u20162 , (30)\nwhere ci is the ith delay sample corresponding to a route choice xi and \u03c4 is total number of delay samples for the source-destination pair considered. Further, \u03bb is a regularization parameter. It is well known that \u03b8\u0302off = A\u22121b,\nwhere A = \u03c4\u2211 i=1 xix T i + \u03bbId and b = \u03c4\u2211 i=1 cixi. Here Id denotes the d-dimensional identity matrix, with d set to the number of lanes in the road network considered. We set the various parameters of the problem as well as bandit routing algorithms - OFUL and WOFUL, as follows:\nAlgorithm Parameters\nOFUL Regularization parameter \u03bb = 1, confidence \u03b4 = 0.99, norm bound \u03b2 = 400\nWOFUL Regularization parameter \u03bb = 1, confidence \u03b4 = 0.99, norm bound \u03b2 = 400, weight function w(p) = p 0.61\n(p0.61+(1\u2212p)0.61) 1 0.61\nWe observed that both OFUL and WOFUL algorithms learn the parameter underlying the linear relationship (Eq. (7) in the main paper) to a good accuracy. For instance, the normalized difference \u2225\u2225\u2225\u03b8alg \u2212 \u03b8\u0302off\u2225\u2225\u22252 / \u2225\u2225\u2225\u03b8\u0302off\u2225\u2225\u22252 \u2248\n0.08 for OFUL (resp. 0.07 for WOFUL) on the 3x3-grid network. Figure 4 shows two road networks - a 3x3-grid and a 11-junction network - used for our experiments. Figure 3 presents the expected and weight-distorted values for OFUL and WOFUL for the 3x3-grid network, while Table 1 presents similar results for the 11-junction network. These values are calculated using a ridge regression-based estimate \u03b8\u0302off of the true parameter \u03b8. As expected, OFUL (resp. WOFUL) algorithm recommends a route xOFUL (resp. xWOFUL) with minimum mean delay (resp. weight-distorted value). As shown in Figure 3, xOFUL is the shortest path, while xWOFUL involves a detour. The lower value of distorted value (delay) for the longer path preferred by WOFUL is presumably due to the fact that the longer route has larger variance in end-to-end delays. Thus, the chance that the route\u2019s delay is small (a rare event) is overestimated by the weight function, making it more appealing to the distortion-conscious WOFUL strategy."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We have designed online learning algorithms to minimize weight-distorted cost \u2013 a generalization of expected value \u2013 in both the standard (unstructured) k-armed bandit and the linearly parameterized bandit settings.

We also present a matching lower bound on the regret, showing that the regret of W-UCB is essentially unimprovable over the class of H\u00f6lder -continuous weight distortions.
