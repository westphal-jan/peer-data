Introduction", "text": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been successfully used in many applications involving time series. This is because RNNs are well suited for sequential data as they process inputs one element at a time and store relevant information in their hidden state. In practice, however, training simple RNNs can be challenging due to the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients (Hochreiter et al., 2001). It has been shown that the exploding gradient problem is likely to occur when the transition matrix of an RNN has a spectral norm larger than one (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). This results in an error surface, associated with some objective function, having very steep walls (Pascanu et al., 2013). Landing on one of these walls during training will result in a very large gradient step, which can disrupt training. On the other hand, when the spectral norm of the transition matrix is less than one, the information at one time step tend to vanish quickly after a few time steps. This makes it challenging to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data.\nDifferent methods have been suggested to solve either the vanishing or exploding gradient problem. The LSTM has been specifically designed to help with the vanishing gradient (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). This is achieved by using gate vectors which allow a linear flow of information through the hidden state. However, the LSTM does not di-\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n00 18\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\nrectly address the exploding gradient problem. In fact, the longer the input sequence is, the more prone the LSTM is to the exploding gradient. One approach to solving this issue is to clip the gradients (Pascanu et al., 2013) when their norm exceeds some threshold value. This has the negative side effect of adding an additional hyperparameter to the model. Furthermore, if the exploding gradient occurs within some parameter search space, the associated error surface will still have steep walls. This makes training challenging even with gradient clipping.\nAnother way to approach this problem is to improve the shape of the error surface directly by making it smoother, which can be achieved by constraining the spectral norm of the transition matrix to be less than or equal to one. However, a value of exactly one is best for the vanishing gradient problem. A good choice of the activation function between hidden states is also crucial in this case. These ideas have been investigated in recent work. In particular, the unitary RNN (Arjovsky et al., 2015) constrains the transition matrix to be in the unitary group U(n) using a special parametrisation. This ensures that the norm of the transition matrix is exactly equal to one. This parametrisation and other similar ones (Hyland & Ra\u0308tsch, 2016; Wisdom et al., 2016) have some advantages and drawbacks which we will discuss in more details in the next section.\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows:\n\u2022 We first show that, constraining the search space of the transition matrix of an RNN to the unitary group U(n) is equivalent to limiting the search space to a subset of the orthogonal group O(2n) of a new RNN with twice the hidden size. This suggests that it may not be necessary to work with complex valued matrices.\n\u2022 We present a simple and efficient way to parametrise orthogonal transition matrices. We show that the time and space complexities of using this parametrisation are, in the worse case, the same as those of the simple RNN. This new parametrisation can be used in other types of neural networks, not just the recurrent ones."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Throughout this work we will refer to elements of the following simple RNN architecture.\nht = \u03c6(Wht\u22121 + V xt), (1) ot = Y ht, (2)\nwhere W , V and Y are the hidden-to-hidden, input-tohidden, and hidden-to-output weight matrices. ht\u22121 and ht are the hidden vectors at time steps t \u2212 1 and t respectively. Finally, \u03c6 is a non-linear activation function. We have omitted the bias terms for simplicity.\nWhen looking at the structure of the transition matrix W , recent research has explored how their initialisation influences training and the ability to learn long-term dependencies. In particular, initialising with specific structures such as the identity or an orthogonal matrix can greatly improve performance (Le et al., 2015). In addition to these initialisation methods, one study has also considered removing the non-linearity between the hidden-to-hidden connections (Henaff et al., 2016), i.e. the termWht\u22121 in Equation 1 is outside the activation function \u03c6. This method showed good results when compared to the LSTM on pathologically synthetic problems exhibiting long-term dependencies.\nAfter training a model for a few iterations using gradient descent, nothing guarantees that the initial structures of the transition matrix will be kept. In fact, its spectral norm can deviate from one, and the exploding and vanishing gradients can be a problem again. It is possible to constrain the transition matrix to be orthogonal during training using more sophisticated methods (Wisdom et al., 2016). However, this comes at the cost of time-complexity. A naive approach is to use gradient descent and project the updated transition matrix onto the orthogonal group using the QR decomposition for example. This incurs a O(n3) cost at each iteration, where n is the size of the hidden layer. This can be an issue when the batch size and the sequence length T are small compared to n.\nRecently, new parametrisations of the transition matrix have been suggested (Arjovsky et al., 2015), which ensure that its spectral norm is always equal to one. This condition is sufficient to ensure that exploding gradients do not occur. Methods such as gradient clipping are made unnecessary. The unitary RNN (uRNN) is one example where the hidden matrix W \u2208 Cn\u00d7n is the product of elementary matrices, consisting of reflection, diagonal, and Fourier transform matrices. When the size of hidden layer is equal to n, the transition matrix has a total of only 7n parameters. Another advantage of this parametrisation is computational efficiency. In particular, the matrix-vector product Wv, for some vector v, can be calculated in time complexity O(n log n). However, it has been shown that this parametrisation does not allow the transition matrix to span the full unitary group (Wisdom et al., 2016), which may limit the model expressiveness.\nAnother interesting parametrisation (Hyland & Ra\u0308tsch, 2016) has been suggested which takes advantage of the algebraic properties of the unitary group U(n). The idea is to use the corresponding matrix Lie algebra u(n) of skew hermitian matrices. In particular, the transition matrix can\nbe written as follows:\nW = exp  n2\u2211 i=1 \u03bbiTi  , (3) where exp is the exponential matrix map and {Ti}n 2\ni=1 are predefined n \u00d7 n matrices forming a bases of the Lie algebra u(n). The learning parameters are the weights {\u03bbi}. The fact that the matrix Lie algebra u(n) is closed and connected ensures that the exponential mapping from u(n) to U(n) is surjective. Therefore, with this parametrisation the search space of the transition matrix spans the whole unitary group. This is one advantage over the original unitary parametrisation (Arjovsky et al., 2015). However, the cost of computing the matrix exponential in Equation (3) is O(n3), where n is the dimension of the hidden state. Evaluating \u2211n2 i=1 \u03bbiTi can also be computationally expensive.\nA more recent method (Wisdom et al., 2016) performs optimisation directly of the Stiefel manifold. The corresponding model was called full-capacity unitary RNN. Using this approach, the transition matrix can span the full unitary group. However, this method involves a matrix inverse as well as matrix-matrix products which have time complexity O(n3). This can be problematic when the size of the hidden layer is large. This method is somewhat similar to the projection approach discussed earlier.\nAll the methods discussed above, except for the original unitary RNN, involve a step that requires at least a O(n3) time complexity. Furthermore, they all require the use of complex matrices. Table 2 summarises the time complexities of various methods, including our approach, for one online gradient step. In the next section, we show that imposing a unitary constraint on a transition matrix W \u2208 Cn\u00d7n is equivalent to imposing a constraint in a subset of the orthogonal group O(2n) on a new RNN with twice the hidden size. Furthermore, since the norm of orthogonal matrices is also always equal to one, using the latter has the same theoretical advantages as using unitary matrices when it comes to exploding gradient problem."}, {"heading": "3. Complex unitary versus orthogonal", "text": "In is possible to show that when the transition matrix W \u2208 Cn\u00d7n of an RNN is unitary, there exists an equivalent representation of this RNN with an orthogonal transition matrix W\u0302 \u2208 R2n\u00d72n.\nIn fact, consider a complex unitary transition matrix W = A + iB \u2208 Cn\u00d7n, where A and B are now real valued matrices in Rn\u00d7n. Furthermore, consider the following new variables\n\u2200t, h\u0302t = [ < (ht) = (ht) ] , V\u0302 = [ < (V ) = (V ) ] , W\u0302 = [ A \u2212B B A ] ,\nwhere < and = denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. Note that h\u0302t \u2208 R2n, W\u0302 \u2208 R2n\u00d72n, V\u0302 \u2208 R2n\u00d7nx , where nx is the dimension of the input vector xt in Equation (1).\nAssuming that the activation function \u03c6 applies to the real and imaginary parts separately, it is easy to show that the update equation of the complex hidden state ht of the unitary RNN can be written in the real space as follows\nh\u0302t = \u03c6(W\u0302 h\u0302t\u22121 + V\u0302 xt). (4)\nEven when the activation function \u03c6 does not apply to the real and imaginary parts separately, it is still possible to find an equivalent real space representation. Take for example the activation function proposed by (Arjovsky et al., 2015)\n\u03c3modRelU(z) = { (|z|+ b) z|z| , if |z|+ b > 0\n0, otherwise (5)\nwhere b is a bias vector. For a hidden state h\u0302 \u2208 R2n, the equivalent activation function in the real space representation (4) is given by\n\u03c6(h\u0302i) =  \u221a h\u03022i+h\u0302 2 ki +bk\u2032 i\u221a h\u03022i+h\u0302 2 ki h\u0302i, if \u221a h\u03022i + h\u0302 2 ki + bk\u2032i > 0\n0, otherwise (6)\nwhere ki = (i + n) mod 2n and k\u2032i = i mod n for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , 2n}. This activation is no longer applied to hidden units independently.\nNow we will show that the matrix W\u0302 is orthogonal. By definition of a unitary matrix, we have WW \u2217 = I where the \u2217 symbol indicates the complex conjugate. This equation implies that\nA2 +B2 = I, (7) BA\u2212AB = 0. (8)\nOn the other hand, we have\nW\u0302W\u0302T = [ A2 +B2 AB \u2212BA BA\u2212AB B2 +A2 ] . (9)\nUsing Equations (7) and (8), it follows that W\u0302W\u0302T = I . Also note that the matrix W has a special structure. It is a block-matrix and its blocks are the matricesA,\u2212B, A, and B.\nThe discussion above shows that using a complex unitary matrix in Cn\u00d7n is equivalent to using an orthogonal matrix, belonging to a subset of O(2n), in a new RNN with twice the hidden size. This is why in this work we focus on parametrising orthogonal matrices directly.\nIn the next section, we present an efficient, and flexible parametrisation of the transition matrix which allows it to span the full orthogonal group."}, {"heading": "4. Parametrisation of the transition matrix", "text": "Before discussing the details of our parametrisation, we need to introduce a few notations.\n\u2022 For n \u2208 N and 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n, we define the mappings\nHk : Rk \u2192 Rn\u00d7n u 7\u2192 [ In\u2212k 0 0 Ik \u2212 2uuT ] ,\n(10)\nwhere Ik denotes the k-dimensional identity matrix. Note that, when \u2016v\u2016 = 1, Hk(u) is simply the Householder Reflection in Rn\u00d7n, which is orthogonal.\n\u2022 For the special case of k = 1, we define H1 as\nH1 : R\u2192 Rn\u00d7n u 7\u2192 [ In\u22121 0 0 u ] ,\n(11)\nwhere u is simply a scalar in this case. Note that, when u \u2208 {1,\u22121}, H1(u) is orthogonal.\nWe propose to parametrise the transition matrix of an RNN using the vectors {ui}, which we will refer to as the reflection vectors in what follows. This parametrisation has many advantage as the following theorem will help us show.\nTheorem 1. Let n \u2208 N and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n we define the mappingMk as follows\nMk : Rk \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Rn \u2192 Rn\u00d7n\n(uk, . . . , un) 7\u2192 Hn(un) . . . Hk(uk),\nwhere the functions {Hk}nk=1 are defined in Equations (10) and (11). Then we have,\n\u2022 The mappingsMk are smooth for all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n.\n\u2022 The image of M1 includes the orthogonal group O(n), i.e.\nO(n) \u2282M1 [R\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Rn] .\nSketch of the proof. The first point of Theorem 1 is straightforward. The mapping Mk is the product of n \u2212 k + 1 smooth maps. Therefore,Mk is also a smooth map.\nNow we need to the show that for every Q\u2032 \u2208 O(n), there exits a tuple of vectors (u1, . . . , un) \u2208 R \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Rn such that Q\u2032 = M1(u1, . . . , un). Algorithm 1 show how a QR decomposition can be performed using the matrices {Hk(uk)}nk=1 while insuring that the upper triangular matrix R has positive diagonal elements. If we apply this algorithm to an orthogonal matrix Q\u2032, we get a tuple (u1, . . . , un) which satisfies\nQR = Hn(un) . . . H1(u1)R = Q \u2032.\nNote that the matrix R must be orthogonal since R = QTQ\u2032. Therefore, R = I , since the only upper triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements is the identity matrix. Hence, we have\nM1(u1, . . . , un) = Hn(un) . . . H1(u1) = Q\u2032.\nWhen using m reflection vectors, the parametrisation can be expressed as\nW =Mn\u2212m+1(un\u2212m+1, . . . , vn) = Hn(un) . . . Hn\u2212m+1(un\u2212m+1), (12)\nThis parametrisation has the following advantages\n\u2022 The parametrisation is smooth, which is convenient for training with gradient descent.\nAlgorithm 1 QR decomposition using the mappings {Hk}nk=1.

To ensure that this is always the case, one method would be to project the vectors onto the unit ball after each gradient step. This would take O(nm) time complexity.\n\u2022 The time and space complexities involved in one gradient step are, in the worst case, the same as that of the simple RNN with the same number of hidden units. This is mainly due to the fact that the transition matrix W does not need to be generated explicitly. In fact, one only needs the matrix-vector products Wv, which are cheaper to compute using our parametrisation.\n\u2022 The parametrisation is flexible. A good trade-off between expressiveness and speed can be found by selecting the right number of reflection vectors.\n\u2022 When the goal is to ensure that the transition matrix W can span the whole orthogonal group, the number of reflection vectors and hidden units be the same. In this case, the number of redundant parameters associated with the transition matrix W is small. In fact, when m = n the total number of parameters needed for W is n(n+ 1)/2. There are only n redundant parameters in this case, since the orthogonal group O(n) is a n(n\u2212 1)/2 manifold.\nNote that H1(u1) is not the standard Householder reflection. The second point of Theorem 5.2.2 (i.e. the subjectivity) would not be true had we used a Householder reflection instead."}, {"heading": "4.1. Time complexity", "text": "When using the parametrisation in (12), we do not need to calculate the matrix W explicitly. We only need the matrix-vector products Wv. The cost of calculating Wv is proportional to O(nm), where m and n are the number of reflection vectors used and the size of the hidden state respectively. Consequently, given a sequence of length T , the time complexity of Forward Propagation (FP) is O(Tmn). Back Propagation Through Time (BPTT) can be achieved within the same time complexity as FP. Note that for a simple RNN the complexity of FP and BPTT are equal to O(Tn2) for one sequence of length T . Therefore, training an RNN using our parametrisation incurs, in the worst case, the same time complexity as the simple RNN. The worst case being when the number of reflection vectors is equal to the size of the hidden state."}, {"heading": "4.2. Space complexity", "text": "Parametrising the transition matrix of an RNN using (12) withm reflections is equivalent to adding m\u22121 intermediate hidden states between any two consecutive time steps.

A naive approach would be to store the values of ht,k for all t \u2264 T and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m \u2212 1. This method would increase the memory storage by a factor of m compared to the case of a simple RNN. This may be acceptable if m is fixed irrespective of the size of the hidden state n. However, when m = n, it is clearly a problem.\nIn order to circumvent this issue, note that the ht,k for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m \u2212 1 do not need to be explicitly stored during the forward propagation. In fact, they can be calculated \u201don the fly\u201d during BPTT, which would only add O(mn) operations at each time step. In fact, from Equation (13), the only ingredients needed to generate the intermediate hidden states at time step t are the reflection vectors {ui}mi=1 and the hidden state ht. Note that having to generate the intermediate vectors locally does not affect the overall time complexity of the BPTT algorithm. AddingO(mn) operations at each time step still results in an overall complexity\nof O(Tmn) for one sequence of length T .\nHowever, unless one implements the BPTT algorithm from scratch, it would be challenging to modify any pre-existing library to manage memory in the way needed for our parametrisation."}, {"heading": "4.3.

However, the problem of learning long-term dependencies in sequences using these networks is still a major challenge. Recent methods have been suggested to solve this problem by constraining the transition matrix to be unitary during training, which ensures that its norm is exactly equal to one. These methods either have limited expressiveness or scale poorly with the size of the network when compared to the simple RNN case, especially in an online learning setting. Our contributions are as follows. We first show that constraining the transition matrix to be unitary is a special case of an orthogonal constraint. Therefore, it may not be necessary to work with complex valued matrices. Then we present a new parametrisation of the transition matrix which allows efficient training of an RNN while insuring that the transition matrix is always orthogonal. Using our approach, one online gradient step can, in the worst case, be performed in time complexity O(Tn), where T and n are the length of the input sequence and the size of the hidden layer respectively.
