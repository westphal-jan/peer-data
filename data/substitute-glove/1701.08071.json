The goal of the most research is to make conversation between human and computer more native and natural. Obviously there are 2 necessary points to achieve this goal: make humans understand computer better and conversely. One can observe a great success in speech recognition (speech to text, STT). Nowadays machines can understand almost all human speech and the related services are used everywhere from Siri-like applications in smartphoes to voice control services. Totally, computer can understand what has been said. But this is not all the data in a voice, it also contains an information about who and how has spoken. The second question motivates us to learn how to recognize emotions from speech. Moreover, text to speech (TTS) services have the same challenging problem: machines can produce only intonationless speech."}, {"heading": "1.1 Emotion recognition problem description", "text": "This paper is dedicated to emotional speech processing. The main goal is to learn how to classify speech by emotional state of a speaker. Unfortunately, there is no fairly strict definition what is emotion. Moreover, as it will be shown further, different people classify emotional speech differently. The second difficulty is about time properties of emotions. Often almost the whole utterance has no emotion (speaker is in neutral state), but emotionality is contained only in a few words or phonemes in an utterance.\nEmotion recognition problem can be reformulated in mathematical terms as a classification task. In brief a function from the utterances space to the set of emotional states has to be constructed. In this space decision rule separates utterances with one emotion from the others. But what if people evaluates utterances differently? If we assume that the utterances emotional states are picked from an\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n08 07\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nunknown probability distribution then the model should predict and process these probabilities in the most sensible way."}, {"heading": "1.2 Relation to prior works", "text": "At the moment the emotion recognition pipeline looks the following:\n\u2022 Choose an emotional speech corpus \u2022 Divide continuous audio signal into emotional utterances \u2022 Calculate features for each utterance \u2022 Select and train a classification model \u2022 Develop a set of evaluation metrics and validate constructed model\nThere are a whole bunch of methods for each of the aforementioned steps. However, there is no panacea for a general problem setting of emotion recognition. One need to modify each step from the list in accordance with the specific properties of the task. The most effective approach takes in account lots of aspects like problem statement, goals, dataset structure, evaluation metrics, etc.\nIn this paper we consider utterance-level classification for speaker-free emotion recognition from natural speech. We decided to choose IEMOCAP database as a speech corpus because it satisfies all of properties of the task described above and there are several well-developed approaches on this emotional corpus to compare.\nBefore 2014 all research does not take into account time properties of the speech but uses only statistics aggregated over the utterances. The first attempt to consider a feature sequence was provided by Han et al. in [1] where they used DNN-based system with the following aggregation over time using statistical functions. They have shown some advantages of this approach, but accuracy was insufficient.\nIn the next year Lee and the same microsoft team [2] trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network with on a feature sequence and achieved about 60% accuracy on IEMOCAP database. They used a special loss function that enables to take into account the fact that emotionality in an utterance exists only in a few frames. Untill now it was the most effective workflow on IEMOCAP database. But the thing is that in their paper Lee et al. sieved the initial database in the way differs from ours. Firstly they considered another set of emotions and secondly they used only improvisation sessions (see 2 for details). Testing our approach under the same conditions we got almost the same quality \u2014 56% mean class accuracy and 59% overall accuracy (see 5.3 for definitions). One more drawback of their work is the lack of code and the unclearness of the important details of the algorithm which makes it hard to reproduce."}, {"heading": "2 Data description", "text": "Regardless of model type, training procedure requires labelled emotional corpus. There are quite a few databases and its\u2019 overview can be found in [3, 4]. We carried out all experiments with an audio data from The Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) database [5].\nIt consists of about 12 hours of audio-visual data from 10 actors. All recordings have a structure of dialogue between a man and a woman either scripted or improvised on the given topic. After collecting this audio-visual signals authors divided dialogues into small utterances of length mainly from 3 to 15 seconds (see fig. 1a for details) and then give them to the assessors to evaluate. Utterances are broken into two \"streams\" (man and woman voices) and thus they sometimes intersects (see fig. 2b). Then from 3 to 4 assessors were asked to evaluate each utterance based on both audio and video streams. The evaluation form contained 10 options (neutral, happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust frustration, excited, other). Here we take for analysis only 4 of them \u2014 anger, excitement, neutral and sadness. Figure 1b shows the distribution of considered emotions among the utterances.\nEmotion was assigned to the utterance only if at least half of experts were consistent in their choice. And obviously it is not always like that. There is a 30% of utterances in which more than a half of experts gave different labels and emotion was not assigned at all. Moreover, from the remained utterances significantly less than a half have all experts consistently evaluate them (fig. 2a). This fact\nillustrates that emotion is a subjective notion and there is no way to classify emotions precisely even if humans can\u2019t do that. In other words any model can not learn to recognize emotions, but can learn how experts label emotional utterances."}, {"heading": "2.1 Technical details", "text": "Usually digital sound acquired as a converted analogous signal from a recording device. Audio wave is discretized and converted into time series with the given discretization frequency called sample rate. In IEMOCAP case, we need to have 16000 integers for one second of a sound with 16 kHz sample rate. Most popular approach to reducing this number is to separate an input signal into intersecting intervals (frames) of 0.1-1 seconds length and calculate acoustic features over it. This sequence of feature vectors represents an input sound in lower dimensional space with enough precision but anyway some information is lost. The other approach is to work with raw signal discretized with a lower frame rate. This approach is more accurate but needs significantly more computational power."}, {"heading": "2.2 Features used", "text": "One of the sticking points in emotion recognition is what features should be used. Almost all possible features can be divided into 3 main classes:\n\u2022 Acoustic features. They are calculated from the input signal and describe wave properties of a speech. Sometimes pitch-based features like chromagram powers are also included in acoustic set, but in some works they are considered separately or in prosodic group.\n\u2022 Prosodic features. Generally, they try to measure peculiarities of speech like pauses between words, prosodies and loudness. Unfortunately, speech details such as prosodic features strongly depend on a speaker, and their use in speaker-free emotion recognition is debatable. In some works prosodic features improve the total efficiency, but we do not use it because the aforementioned reason.\n\u2022 Linguistic features. The third kind of frequently used features based on semantic information from speech. We also do not use them because usually exact transcriptions are unavailable.\nSo in this paper we consider only acoustic features that measure wave properties of a signal. Along with Fourier frequencies and energy-based features Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are usually used. Fourier transformation of the current time interval of the input signal can be considered as another signal and MFCC features measure its frequencies and powers.\nFinally, 34 features are used. They include 12 MFCC, chromagram-based and spectrum properties like flux and roll-off. For all speech intervals we calculate features in 0.2 second window and moving it with 0.1 second step. For example, 4 seconds signal results in 78 vectors of dimension 34."}, {"heading": "3 Problem statement", "text": "Emotion recognition task can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem in mathematical terms. This reformulation allows to apply wide range of well-established methods.\nLet D = {(X, z)}ni=1 be the training set where zi \u2208 Z = E\u2217 = {0 . . . k \u2212 1}\u2217 is the true sequence of labels and Xi \u2208 X = ( Rf )\u2217\n\u2014 corresponding multidimensional feature sequence. It\u2019s worth to mention that the lengths of these sequences |zi| = Ui and |Xi| = Ti may not be the same in general case, the only constraint is the Ui \u2264 Ti condition. Also let\u2019s divide the dataset into train and validation sets D = Dl \u222a Dv with sizes Nl and Nv correspondingly. Il and Iv show the corresponding split of indexes. Further we introduces the set of classification functions F = {f : X 7\u2192 Z} in which we want to find the best model. In case of neural network with the fixed architecture it is possible to associate the set of functions F with the network weights spaceW and thus function f and vector of weights w are interchangeable.\nNext step it to introduce the loss function. As in almost all classification tasks here we are interested in accuracy error measure. But due to it\u2019s non-convexity we are unable to optimize it directly and thus we use the convex approximation which is denoted as L(z,y) where y is the answer of the model. Assume that there is an \"perfect\" classifier f\u2217. Our task is to find f\u2217F that approximate f\n\u2217 in the best possible way. It can be done using the risk minimization approach:\nf\u2217F = argmin f\u2208F E (X,z) [L (z, f(X))] .\nBut real data distribution in X \u00d7 Z space is unknown and thus it is impossible to calculate the expected value properly. Therefore it is common to minimize an empirical risk:\nf\u0302 = argmin f\u2208F\n1\nNl \u2211 Dl L (zi, f(Xi)) = argmin w\u2208W Q (w,Dl,L) .\nThereby we have f\u0302 \u2014 approximation of f\u2217F built based on the available data. Common approach here to reduce overfitting is to check the validation error from time to time during the optimization process and to stop when it starts growing."}, {"heading": "4 Recognition methods", "text": "Throughout this paper we use a few recurrent neural network models for emotions detection in the human speech. The general structure stays more or less the same : input layer, few LSTM layers stacked over each other, dense classification layers and output softmax layer. One can address to the experiment section 5 for a more detailed architectures description. Below there is an overview of two main approaches to the network training that we used in this paper."}, {"heading": "4.1 One-label approach", "text": "One-label approach implies that every utterance has only one emotional label notwithstanding it\u2019s length. It is the obvious approach regarding datasets labelled with the utterance annotation technique [5].\nIn details, let all the lengths of the label sequences are equal to 1, Ui = |zi| = 1. Then vector z becomes scalar z\nThe recurrent neural network can be thought as a mapping from the input feature space X to the probability distribution over the emotional class labels parameterized with the model weights y = Nw(X) \u2208 [0; 1]k, where y is the output of the softmax layer. The loss function here is the categorical cross-entropy loss. Below there is an objective function to minimize based on this loss:\nQ(w,Dl,L) = \u2212 1\nNl \u2211 i\u2208Il k\u22121\u2211 c=0 zi,c log yi,c\nwhere class labels zi are encoded with the one-hot encoding and yi = Nw(Xi).\nThe final classification is made by means of agrmax rule over the outputs of the trained model:\nf\u0302(X) = argmax c\u2208E yc\nIn the figure 3 one can see the whole workflow of the described approach.\nUntil recently this approach with different types of a models (i.e. HMM or Gaussian Mixtures) has been considered as a state-of-the-art.\nThe drawback of such an approach is obvious from it\u2019s name \u2014 it converts sequence of arbitrary length into one label. One more potential but nonetheless significant problem with one-label approach is on the fly work. In the online setting there is continuous audio flow without assessor\u2019s split into utterances. Thus the ability to predict the sequence of emotions per one utterance is crucial.\nThe most recent advance in the field of natural language processing is the use of so called end-to-end or sequence-to-sequence models which is described next in 4.2"}, {"heading": "4.2 CTC approach", "text": "Connectionist Temporal Classificaion (CTC) approach is the one among many end-to-end prediction methods. The main advantage of CTC is that it chooses the most probable label sequence regarding the various ways of aligning it with the initial sequence. The probability of the particular labelling is added up from the probabilities of every it\u2019s alignment.\nMore formally, let Dl still be the training set but unlike one-label approach the answer can be a sequence now.\nFurther we expand the label set E and introduce one more label \u2014 NULL. This label can be interpreted as a lack of emotion. Technically it reflects in one more unit in the last softmax layer of neural net. So the final label set is the following: L = E \u222a {NULL}. As in the one-label approach let\u2019s consider the work of the model as a mapping but here the codomain is also the sequence space Y = Nw(X) \u2208 [0; 1](k+1)\u00d7T . Here ytc is the output of the softmax layer and represents the estimation for the probability of observing class c in the moment t.\nFor every input X let\u2019s define the path \u03c0 \u2014 it is the arbitrary sequence from L\u2217 with the length T . Then the conditional probability of the path is\np(\u03c0|X) = T\u220f t=1 yt\u03c0t .\nThe problem is that paths contain NULL class labels which are unacceptable at the final output. So first need is to get rid of the NULLs. Therefore mapping M : LT 7\u2192 E\u2264T is introduced. It consist of the few stages:\n1. Delete all consequent repeated labels, 2. Delete all NULLs\nOne can think of the following application: M (\u2212aa\u2212 b\u2212 b\u2212\u2212ccc) = M (abb\u2212\u2212\u2212 bc\u2212) = abbc. From this example it is obvious that M is the surjective mapping. By means of it we transform paths to labellings. The method for computing the probability of the labelling is simple:\np(l|X) = \u2211\n\u03c0\u2208M\u22121(l)\np(\u03c0|X).\nOne could notice that the direct calculation of p(l|X) requires summation over all corresponding paths which is very exhausting \u2014 there are (k+1)T possible paths. Thus Graves et al. in [6] derived a new efficient forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm for that. The initial idea was taken from Rabiner [7] HMM decoding algorithm.\nFinally, the objective function to minimize in this approach is based on the maximal likelihood principle. We try to maximize the probabilities of all correct answers at the same time:\nQ(w,Dl) = \u2212 \u2211 i\u2208Il log p(zi|Xi)\nNeural network here plays a role of evaluator of probability measure p and the more it trains the more precise probability estimations it gives. To enable the neural network training with the standard gradient-based methods Graves et al. [6] also suggested differentiation technique naturally embedded into dynamic programming algorithm.\nThe final classification rule is the one that maximizes the probability of the answer:\nf\u0302(X) = argmax l\u2208E\u2264T p(l|X)\nIn the figure 4 the pipeline for the CTC method is depicted in the way similar to one-label approach."}, {"heading": "5 Emotion recognition experiments", "text": "In series of experiments we investigated different models and approaches to the emotion recognition task. All the code can be found in github repository [8]\nAs it was mentioned in section 2, data structure is the following \u2014 dialogues are broken into utterances by human assessors. Utterance is the least structural unit with emotion tag in original\nlabelling. But utterances considerably vary in length. Thus we decided to split them into overlapped frames of 0.2 seconds duration with overlapping of 0.1 second. The problem is that frames have no labels. While it is obvious that not all frames of angry utterance also can be referred as an angry frames.\nFurther in this paper, unless otherwise specified, the test set consists of 20% points randomly picked from dataset.\nAlso two neural network structures are mainly used:\n\u2022 Simple LSTM. It consists of two consecutive LSTM layers with hyperbolic tangent activations followed by two classification dense layers.\n\u2022 Bidirectional LSTM. Network contains two BLSM layers each of which splits into two parts \u2014 half of nodes are usual LSTM blocks and other half is BLSTM units.\nMore detailed diagrams are shown in the figure 10 and can be found in appendix A."}, {"heading": "5.1 Framewise classification", "text": "The first method that was applied is framewise classification. The core of this method is to try to classify each frame separately. Under specified conditions we come up with the following workflow:\n\u2022 Take two of the loudest frames from each utterance. Loudness in this context is the synonymous for spectral power\n\u2022 Assign these frames with the emotion of the utterance \u2022 Train the frame classification model on the derived dataset\nHere we make an assumption that the emotion of the utterance contains not in all frames of it but only in the loudest ones. Experiment shows that 2 frames is the optimal number. Regarding the classification model we used Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn package [9].\nIn the figure 5 one can observe the results of this method for random utterances from the test set. In glance it looks somewhat reasonable with short utterances. On the longer ones it becomes sawtooth and unstable.\nThe next step is to classify utterances based on its\u2019 artificial labellings. Simple majority voting algorithm gives about 44% accuracy. Taking into account that neutral class is about 36% of a dataset it looks not very good. Moreover, the thing is that error distribution in that case looks unnatural in\ncomparison with the human one got by us. 70% of the answers are neutral, which implicitly confirm our assumptions that most of the frames in the utterances don\u2019t have any emotion.\nApplying simple LSTM network doesn\u2019t give any significant improvement and BLSTM network drastically overfits and we can\u2019t escape from this effect without significant loss in quality.\nSummarizing, frames pre-classification shows itself not brilliant in this task. We believe that the main reason is lack of markup on the frame level. Choosing two frame from utterance is too inaccurate method for labelling samples. On par with it, we can state that hypothesis about neutral character of most part of the frames holds."}, {"heading": "5.2 Utterance-level classification", "text": "The idea of the following experiment is to use frame features themselves as an input to the neural network model. There is a rationale behind it, because with the framewise approach we don\u2019t get any additional information after the intermediate RFC stage. The key idea in utterance level classification is that RNN can learn sufficient features from input features stream itself and made the final classification based on them.\nHere we experiment with two approaches described in section 4. 5-fold cross-validation technique is used to evaluate and compare them."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 One-label approach", "text": "BLSTM network outperforms Simple LSTM network within this approach. In the figure 6 the performance analysis is shown.\nAs one can see from the plots in figure 6a that 20-22 epochs is enough for training and after that model starts to overfit. Accuracy evolution curves can be found in figure 11a placed in appendix A. In the bar chart 6b the results of CV are shown. Number of epochs for training was chosen accordingly to previously obtained number \u2014 20."}, {"heading": "5.2.2 CTC approach", "text": "Performance indicators for CTC approach are given in the figures 7 and 11b in appendix A.\nIt is worth to mention that BLSTM with CTC loss requires approximately two times more epochs to train properly comparing to crossentropy loss. The interesting and important feature to notice is that network with CTC loss does not overfit."}, {"heading": "5.3 Comparison", "text": "As we considering multiclass classification task with a little unbalanced classes, it is essential to look not only on overall accuracy but on class accuracies too. Thus we introduce two type of metrics:\n\u2022 Overall (weighted) accuracy. It is an accuracy on the entire test set. \u2022 Mean class (unweighted) accuracy. Is is average classification accuracies for each class.\nIn the table 1 the aforementioned metrics are shown for each method we used throughout the paper. The last line of the table corresponds to the human assessors who was asked to relabel this dataset. All the details about how and why it was done are in the sections 5.4 and 6"}, {"heading": "5.4 Error structure", "text": "We also decided to further investigate the CTC model because Graves in [6] reports about huge gap in quality over classical models. While here the gain is about 3-5%. It is still significant but not the breakthrough. For that reason the error structure of our most successful model is studied.\nFirst of all, it\u2019s useful to take a look on predictions distribution in comparison with \"ground truth\" from experts. This distribution is shown in the figure 8a. Busso in his work [5] mentions that audio signal plays the main role in sadness recognition while angry and excitement are better detected via video signal which accompanies audio during the assessors work. This hypothesis seems to be true in relation to our model. Sadness recognition percentage is much higher than the others. It also maybe interesting to compare it with the human error structure shown in the figure 9a\nAlso as it was said in section 2 dataset has not the homogeneous structure in sense of expert answers reliability. It is interesting to see (fig. 8b) how the model predictions depend on the expert confidence degree. For that purpose we first differentiate utterances by the confidence degree of experts. On the x-axis one can see the number of experts whose answer differs from the final emotion assigned to the utterance. In each cell of a table there is a model error percentage with particular emotion corresponding to y coordinate and particular confidence level corresponding to x coordinate.\nIn fact this matrix gives curious information \u2014 if we take in account only those utterances in which experts were consistent then we get 65% accuracy. It sounds much more promising that 54% and this transition can be treated legal because emotion is something very subjective. Recognizing a truck or a flower on a picture can be evaluated objectively and in tasks like that computers have already outperform humans [10]. But emotion is something different which can\u2019t be defined properly. Thus\neven if human can\u2019t be sure in right understanding of emotions then our model can\u2019t guarantee it as well.\nOne more interesting thing to notice here is not only the quantity of inconsistent answers but also this answers themselves. As it was discussed previously some experts give answers not the same as the final emotion of the utterances. These answers can be arbitrary emotion and here we select only those four considered before. Thereby in the first row of the table 2 there is the percentage of inconsistent answers from utterances treated as having emotion with the name from the header of the column fallen into considered four emotions. And in the second row there is the percentage of model answers that coincide with inconsistent expert in this case.\nIn other words table 2 shows how frequently the errors of our model coincide with the human divergence in emotion assessment.\nAll these facts and ideas lead us to the final and still ongoing part of the research described in section 6."}, {"heading": "6 Markup investigation", "text": "Observing inconsistency of experts and other problems of the markup described in the sections 5.4 and 2 we come with the idea that it will be interesting and useful to see how humans perform in that task.\nThis question is not new and previously arised in the papers. Altrov in [11] collected the corpus of Estonian speech and asked people of different nationalities to evaluate it. Almost all nationalities (Latvians, Italians, Finns, Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, Russians) were close to Estonians geographically and culturally. Nevertheless Estonians perform much better than any other nationality showing about 69% mean class accuracy. All other people perform 10-15% worse and the only emotion that they recognise well was sadness.\nIn our research we developed a simple interface (fig. 9b) for relabelling speech corpus to see how well humans can solve this task. In the figure 9a you can see the results of the experiments taken.\nBoth types of accuracies we considered before are about 70% (tab. 1). These numbers confirm the idea that the emotion is the notion treated differently by different people. And having this 70% as a milestone we can say that our model performs very good."}, {"heading": "7 Future work", "text": "For future we see two main directions of the research:\n\u2022 Improve model characteristics. Now there are plenty of ways to do it. First thing is to further experiment with the net structure but based on our experience it can not greatly reduce the quality. The second way is to use more sophisticated feature generation framework or to come up with the new one. The final way that we see is to try to use raw audio signal as an input for the model. Recently Google DeepMind group shows [12] that it is possible to use raw audio signal to generate speech and more than that this algoritm greatly surpasses all other advances in this field. We believe that technical details of their work allow to adapt it to the emotion recognition task and this way looks the most promising.\n\u2022 Improve markup and collect new dataset. As we showed in this paper both the markup and dataset collection methodology have a strong and crucial effect on the properties of the model. So one way it to try to relabel IEMOCAP dataset using developed interface and the new methodology which allows to tune our model better. Other way which we like the most is to collect new database in Russian language. In fact there is no russian emotional speech corpus which we can get freely. Now we are moving our labelling interface to web and soon it will be ready to launch. Also we think that there is no need to hire actors to read dialogues. Nowadays there are a lot of stand-ups, TED-talks etc. in the internet where one man speaks considerable amount of time with emotions. Our work is to split it and give it to the assessors. This way it will be even more natural than the artificially played emotions from actors."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we proposed a novel approach for emotion recognition from audio.

The effectiveness of such an approach is shown in two ways. First one is the comparison with recent advances in this field.
