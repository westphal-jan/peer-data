This is different from document level summarization task since it is hard to apply existing techniques in extractive methods, such as extracting sentence level features and ranking sentences. Early works propose using rule-based methods (Zajic et al., 2007), syntactic tree pruning methods (Knight and Marcu, 2002), statistical machine translation techniques (Banko et al., 2000) and so on for this task. We focus on abstractive sentence summarization task in this paper.\nRecently, neural network models have been applied in this task. Rush et al. (2015) use autoconstructed sentence-headline pairs to train a neu-\n\u2217Contribution during internship at Microsoft Research.\nral network summarization model. They use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and feed-forward neural network language model decoder for this task. Chopra et al. (2016) extend their work by replacing the decoder with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Nallapati et al. (2016) follow this line and change the encoder to RNN to make it a full RNN based sequence-tosequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014).\nAll the above works fall into the encodingdecoding paradigm, which first encodes the input sentence to an abstract representation and then decodes the intended output sentence based on the encoded information. As an extension of the encoding-decoding framework, attentionbased approach (Bahdanau et al., 2015) has been broadly used: the encoder produces a list of vectors for all tokens in the input, and the decoder uses an attention mechanism to dynamically extract encoded information and align with the output tokens. This approach achieves huge success in tasks like machine translation, where alignment between all parts of the input and output are required. However, in abstractive sentence summarization, there is no explicit alignment relationship between the input sentence and the summary exar X iv :1\n70 4.\n07 07\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 A\npr 2\n01 7\ncept for the extracted common words. The challenge here is not to infer the alignment, but to select the highlights while filtering out secondary information in the input. A desired work-flow for abstractive sentence summarization is encoding, selection, and decoding. After selecting the important information from an encoded sentence, the decoder produces the output summary using the selected information. For example, in Figure 1, given the input sentence, the summarization system first selects the important information, and then rephrases or paraphrases to produce a well-organized summary. Although this is implicitly modeled in the encoding-decoding framework, we argue that abstractive sentence summarization shall benefit from explicitly modeling this selection process.\nIn this paper we propose Selective Encoding for Abstractive Sentence Summarization (SEASS). We treat the sentence summarization as a threephase task: encoding, selection, and decoding. It consists of a sentence encoder, a selective gate network, and a summary decoder. First, the sentence encoder reads the input words through an RNN unit to construct the first level sentence representation. Then the selective gate network selects the encoded information to construct the second level sentence representation. The selective mechanism controls the information flow from encoder to decoder by applying a gate network according to the sentence information, which helps improve encoding effectiveness and release the burden of the decoder. Finally, the attention-equipped decoder generates the summary using the second level sentence representation. We conduct experiments on English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and Microsoft Research Abstractive Text Compression test sets. Our SEASS model achieves 17.54 ROUGE-2 F1, 9.56 ROUGE-2 recall and 10.63 ROUGE-2 F1 on these test sets respectively, which improves performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Abstractive sentence summarization, also known as sentence compression and similar to headline generation, is used to help compress or fuse the selected sentences in extractive document summarization systems since they may inadvertently include unnecessary information. The sentence summarization task has been long connected to the headline generation task. There are some previous\nmethods to solve this task, such as the linguistic rule-based method (Dorr et al., 2003). As for the statistical machine learning based methods, Banko et al. (2000) apply statistical machine translation techniques by modeling headline generation as a translation task and use 8000 article-headline pairs to train the system.\nRush et al. (2015) propose leveraging news data in Annotated English Gigaword (Napoles et al., 2012) corpus to construct large scale parallel data for sentence summarization task. They propose an ABS model, which consists of an attentive Convolutional Neural Network encoder and an neural network language model (Bengio et al., 2003) decoder. On this Gigaword test set and DUC 2004 test set, the ABS model produces the state-of-theart results. Chopra et al. (2016) extend this work, which keeps the CNN encoder but replaces the decoder with recurrent neural networks. Their experiments showes that the CNN encoder with RNN decoder model performs better than Rush et al. (2015). Nallapati et al. (2016) further change the encoder to an RNN encoder, which leads to a full RNN sequence-to-sequence model. Besides, they enrich the encoder with lexical and statistic features which play important roles in traditional feature based summarization systems, such as NER and POS tags, to improve performance. Experiments on the Gigaword and DUC 2004 test sets show that the above models achieve state-of-theart results.\nGu et al. (2016) and Gulcehre et al. (2016) come up similar ideas that summarization task can benefit from copying words from input sentences. Gu et al. (2016) propose CopyNet to model the copying action in response generation, which also applies for summarization task. Gulcehre et al. (2016) propose a switch gate to control whether to copy from source or generate from decoder vocabulary. Zeng et al. (2016) also propose using copy mechanism and add a scalar weight on the gate of GRU/LSTM for this task. Cheng and Lapata (2016) use an RNN based encoder-decoder for extractive summarization of documents.\nYu et al. (2016) propose a segment to segment neural transduction model for sequence-tosequence framework. The model introduces a latent segmentation which determines correspondences between tokens of the input sequence and the output sequence. Experiments on this task show that the proposed transduction model per-\nforms comparable to the ABS model. Shen et al. (2016) propose to apply Minimum Risk Training (MRT) in neural machine translation to directly optimize the evaluation metrics. Ayana et al. (2016) apply MRT on abstractive sentence summarization task and the results show that optimizing for ROUGE improves the test performance."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Formulation", "text": "For sentence summarization, given an input sentence x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), where n is the sentence length, xi \u2208 Vs and Vs is the source vocabulary, the system summarizes x by producing y = (y1, y2, . . . , yl), where l \u2264 n is the summary length , yi \u2208 Vt and Vt is the target vocabulary.\nIf |y| \u2286 |x|, which means all words in summary y must appear in given input, we denote this as extractive sentence summarization.

We focus on abstracive sentence summarization task in this paper."}, {"heading": "4 Model", "text": "As shown in Figure 2, our model consists of a sentence encoder using the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), a selective gate network and an attention-equipped GRU decoder. First, the bidirectional GRU encoder reads the input words x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and builds its representation (h1, h2, . . . , hn). Then the selective gate selects and filters the word representations according to the sentence meaning representation to produce a tailored sentence word representation for abstractive sentence summarization task. Lastly, the GRU decoder produces the output summary with attention to the tailored representation. In the following sections, we introduce the sentence encoder, the selective mechanism, and the summary decoder respectively."}, {"heading": "4.1 Sentence Encoder", "text": "The role of the sentence encoder is to read the input sentence and construct the basic sentence representation. Here we employ a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) as the recurrent unit, where GRU is defined as:\nzi = \u03c3(Wz[xi, hi\u22121]) ri = \u03c3(Wr[xi, hi\u22121])\nh\u0303i = tanh(Wh[xi, ri hi\u22121])\nhi = (1\u2212 zi) hi\u22121 + zi h\u0303i\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nwhere Wz , Wr and Wh are weight matrices. The BiGRU consists of a forward GRU and a backward GRU. The forward GRU reads the input sentence word embeddings from left to right and gets a sequence of hidden states, (~h1,~h2, . . . ,~hn). The backward GRU reads the input sentence embeddings reversely, from right to left, and results in another sequence of hidden states, ( ~h1, ~h2, . . . , ~hn):\n~hi = GRU(xi,~hi\u22121) ~hi = GRU(xi, ~hi+1)\n(5)\n(6)\nThe initial states of the BiGRU are set to zero vectors, i.e., ~h1 = 0 and ~hn = 0. After reading the sentence, the forward and backward hidden states are concatenated, i.e., hi = [~hi; ~hi], to get the basic sentence representation."}, {"heading": "4.2 Selective Mechanism", "text": "In the sequence-to-sequence machine translation (MT) model, the encoder and decoder are responsible for mapping input sentence information to a list of vectors and decoding the sentence representation vectors to generate an output sentence (Bahdanau et al., 2015). Some previous works apply this framework to summarization generation tasks (Nallapati et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Gulcehre et al., 2016). However, abstractive sentence summarization is different from MT in two ways. First, there is no explicit alignment relationship between the input sentence and the output summary except for the common words. Second, summarization task needs to keep the highlights and remove the unnecessary information, while MT needs to keep all information literally.\nHerein, we propose a selective mechanism to model the selection process for abstractive sentence summarization. The selective mechanism\nextends the sequence-to-sequence model by constructing a tailored representation for abstractive sentence summarization task. Concretely, the selective gate network in our model takes two vector inputs, the sentence word vector hi and the sentence representation vector s. The sentence word vector hi is the output of the BiGRU encoder and represents the meaning and context information of word xi. The sentence vector s is used to represent the meaning of the sentence. For each word xi, the selective gate network generates a gate vector sGatei using hi and s, then the tailored representation is constructed, i.e., h\u2032i.\nIn detail, we concatenate the last forward hidden state ~hn and backward hidden state ~h1 as the sentence representation s:\ns =\n[ ~h1\n~hn\n] (7)\nFor each time step i, the selective gate takes the sentence representation s and BiGRU hidden hi as inputs to compute the gate vector sGatei:\nsGatei = \u03c3(Wshi +Uss+ b) h\u2032i = hi sGatei (8) (9)\nwhere Ws and Us are weight matrices, b is the bias vector, \u03c3 denotes sigmoid activation function, and is element-wise multiplication. After the selective gate network, we obtain another sequence of vectors (h\u20321, h \u2032 2, . . . , h \u2032 n). This new sequence is then used as the input sentence representation for the decoder to generate the summary."}, {"heading": "4.3 Summary Decoder", "text": "On top of the sentence encoder and the selective gate network, we use GRU with attention as the decoder to produce the output summary.\nAt each decoding time step t, the GRU reads the previous word embedding wt\u22121 and previous context vector ct\u22121 as inputs to compute the new hidden state st. To initialize the GRU hidden state, we use a linear layer with the last backward encoder hidden state ~h1 as input:\nst = GRU(wt\u22121, ct\u22121, st\u22121)\ns0 = tanh(Wd ~h1 + b)\n(10)\n(11)\nwhere Wd is the weight matrix and b is the bias vector.\nThe context vector ct for current time step t is computed through the concatenate attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015), which matches the current decoder state st with each encoder hidden state h\u2032i to get an importance score.

For the test set, we use the same randomly heldout test set of 2000 sentence-summary pairs as Rush et al. (2015).2\nWe also find that except for the empty titles, this test set has some invalid lines like the input sentence containing only one word.

For English Gigaword5 and MSR-ATC6 test sets, the outputs have different lengths so we evaluate the system with F1 metric. As for the DUC 2004 test set7, the task requires the system to produce a fixed length summary (75 bytes), therefore we employ ROUGE recall as the evaluation metric. To satisfy the length requirement, we decode the output summary to a roughly expected length following Rush et al.

We group the sentences with an interval of 4 and get 18 different groups and we draw the first 14 groups.

For the groups of 16, 20, 24, 32, 56 and 60, the SEASS model obtains big improvements compared to the s2s+att model. Overall, these improvements on all groups indicate that the selective encoding method benefits the abstractive sentence summarization task.\nSaliency Heat Map of Selective Gate Since the output of the selective gate network is a high dimensional vector, it is hard to visualize all the gate values. We use the method in Li et al. (2016) to visualize the contribution of the selective gate to the final output, which can be approximated by the first derivative. Given sentence words x with associated output summary y, the trained model associates the pair (x, y) with a score Sy(x). The goal is to decide which gate g associated with a specific word makes the most significant contribution to Sy(x). We approximate the Sy(g) by computing the first-order Taylor expansion since the score Sy(x) is a highly non-linear function in the deep neural network models:\nSy(g) \u2248 w(g)T g + b (19)\nwhere w(g) is first the derivative of Sy with respect to the gate g:\nw(g) = \u2202(Sy)\n\u2202g |g (20)\nWe then draw the Euclidean norm of the first derivative of the output y with respect to the selective gate g associated with each input words.\nFigure 3 shows an example of the first derivative heat map, in which most of the important words are selected by the selective gate such as \u201ceurope\u201d, \u201cslammed\u201d, \u201cunacceptable\u201d, \u201cconditions\u201d, and \u201cfrance\u201d.
