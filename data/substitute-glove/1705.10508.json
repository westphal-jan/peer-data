INTRODUCTION\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has recently spread use in the wireless communications field to solve many kinds of problems such as Access Point (AP) association [1], channel selection [2] or transmit power adjustment [3], as it allows learning good-performing configurations only from the observed results. Among these, Q-learning has been applied to dynamic channel assignment in mobile networks in [4] and to automatic channel selection in Femto Cell networks in [5]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the case of a fully decentralized scenario where nodes do not have knowledge from each other, has not yet been considered.\nIn this work we propose a stateless variation of Q-learning in which nodes select the transmission power and channel to use solely based on their resulting throughput. We concentrate on a fully decentralized scenario where no information about the actions and resulting performance of the other nodes is available to the learners. Note that inferring the throughput of neighbouring nodes allocated to different channels is costly as periodic sensing in the other channels would then be needed. We aim to characterize the performance of Q-learning in such scenarios, obtaining insight on the most played actions (i.e., channel and transmit power selected) and the resulting performance. We observe that when no information about the neighbours is available to the learners, these will tend to apply selfish strategies that result in alternating good/poor performance depending on the actions of the others. In such scenarios, we show that the use of Q-learning allows each\nnetwork to find the best-performing actions, though without reaching a steady solution. Note that achieving a steady solution in a decentralized environment relies in finding a Nash Equilibrium, a concept used in Game Theory to define a set of individual strategies that maximize the profits of each player in a non-cooperative game, regardless of the others\u2019 strategy. Formally, a set of best player actions a\u2217 = (a\u22171, ..., a \u2217 n) \u2208 A leads to a Nash Equilibrium if a\u2217i \u2208 Bi(a\u2217\u2212i), \u2200i \u2208 N , where Bi(a\u2212i) is the best response to the others actions (a\u2212i). Thus, the consequences of not reaching a Nash Equilibrium can have an impact on performance variability.\nIn addition, we look at the resulting performance in terms of throughput when varying several parameters intrinsic to the learning algorithm, which helps in understanding the interactions between the degree of exploration and learning rate, and the variability of the resulting performance.\nThe remaining of this document is structured as follows: Section II introduces the simulation scenario and considerations. Then, Section III presents our Stateless variation of Q-learning and its practical implementation for the resource allocation problem in Wireless Networks (WNs). Simulation results are later discussed in Section IV. Finally, some final remarks are provided in Section V."}, {"heading": "II.

DECENTRALIZED STATELESS Q-LEARNING FOR ENHANCING SPATIAL REUSE IN WNS", "text": "Q-learning [6, 7] is an RL technique that enables an agent to learn the optimal policy to follow in a given environment. A set of possible states describing the environment and actions are defined in this model. In particular, an agent maintains an estimate of the expected long-term discounted reward for each state-action pair, and selects actions with the aim of maximizing it. The expected cumulative reward V\u03c0(s) is given by:\nV\u03c0(s) = lim N\u2192\u221e E\n( N \u2211\nt=1\nr\u03c0t (s) ) ,\nwhere r\u03c0t (s) is the reward obtained at iteration t after starting from state s and by following policy \u03c0. Since the reward may easily get unbounded, a discount factor parameter (\u03b3 < 1) is used. The optimal policy \u03c0\u2217 that maximizes the total expected reward is given by the Bellman\u2019s Optimality Equation [6]:\nQ\u2217(s, a) = E { rt+1 + \u03b3maxa\u2032Q \u2217(st+1, a \u2032)|st = s, at = a } .\nHenceforth, Q-learning receives information about the current state-action tuple (st, at), the generated reward rt and the next state st+1, in order to update the Q-table: Q\u0302(st, at)\u2190 (1\u2212\u03b1t)Q\u0302(st, at)+\u03b1t ( rt+\u03b3 (\nmax a\u2032\nQ\u0302(st+1, a \u2032) )\n)\n,\nwhere \u03b1t is the learning rate at time t, and max a\u2032\nQ\u0302(st+1, a \u2032)\nis the best estimated value for the next state st+1. The optimal solution is theoretically achieved with probability 1 if \u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b1t = \u221e, and \u2211\u221e t=0 \u03b1 2 t < \u221e, which satisfies that\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nQ\u0302(s, a) = Q\u2217(s, a). Since we focus on a completely\ndecentralized scenario where no information about the other nodes is available, the system can then be fully described by the set of actions and rewards.1 Thus, we propose using a stateless variation of the original Q-learning algorithm. To implement decentralized learning to the resource allocation problem, we consider each WN to be an agent running Stateless Q-learning through an \u03b5-greedy action-selection strategy, so that actions a \u2208 A correspond to all the possible configurations that can be chosen with respect to the channel and transmit power. During the learning process we assume that WNs select actions sequentially, so that at each learning iteration, every agent takes an action in an ordered way. The order at which WNs choose an action at each iteration is randomly selected at the beginning of it. The reward after choosing an action is set as:\nri,t = \u0393i,t \u0393\u2217i ,\nwhere \u0393i,t is the experienced throughput at time t by WN i \u2208 {1, ..., n}, being n the number of WNs in the scenario, and \u0393\u2217i = B log2(1 + SNRi) is WN i maximum achievable throughput (i.e., when it uses the maximum transmission power and there is no interference). Each WN applies the Stateless Q-learning as follows:\n\u2022 Initially, it sets the estimates of its actions k \u2208 {1, ...,K} to 0: Q\u0302(ak) = 0. \u2022 At each iteration, it applies an action by following the \u03b5greedy strategy, i.e., it selects the best-rewarding action\nwith probability 1 \u2212 \u03b5t, and a random one (uniformly distributed) the rest of the times. \u2022 After choosing action ak, it observes the generated reward (the relative experienced throughput), and updates the\nestimated value Q\u0302(ak). \u2022 Finally, \u03b5t is updated to follow a decreasing sequence:\n\u03b5t = \u03b50\u221a t .\nNote, as well, that the optimal policy cannot be derived for the presented scenario, but it can be approximated to enhance spatial reuse. This is due to the nature of the presented environment, as well as WNs decisions affect the others performance. Formally, the implementation details of Stateless Q-learning are described in Algorithm 1. The presented learning approach is intended to operate at the PHY level, allowing the operation of the current MAC-layer communication standards (e.g., in IEEE 802.11 WLANs, the channel access is governed by the CSMA/CA operation, so that Stateless Q-learning may contribute to improve spatial reuse at the PHY level)."}, {"heading": "IV.

The\n3The analysis of the presented learning mechanisms in more congested scenarios is left as future work.\noptimal solutions are listed in Table II. Note that, since the considered scenario is symmetric, there are two equivalent solutions. Note, as well, that in order to maximize the aggregate network throughput two of the WNs sacrifice themselves by choosing a lower transmit power. This result is then not likely to occur in an adversarial selfish setting.\nC. Input Parameters Analysis\nWe first analyse the effects of modifying \u03b1 (the learning rate), \u03b3 (the discount factor) and \u03b50 (the initial exploration coefficient of the \u03b5-greedy update rule) with respect to the achieved network throughput. We run simulations of 10000 iterations and capture the results of the last 5000 iterations to ensure that the initial transitory phase has ended. Each simulation is repeated 100 times for averaging purposes. Figure 1 shows the average aggregate throughput achieved for each of the proposed combinations. It can be observed that the best results with respect to the aggregate throughput, regarding both average and variance, are achieved when \u03b1 = 1, \u03b3 = 0.95 and \u03b50 = 1. This means that for achieving the best results (i.e., high average aggregate throughput and low variance), the immediate reward of a given action must be considered rather than any previous information (\u03b1 = 1). We see that the difference between the pay-off offered by the best action and the current one must also be high (\u03b3 = 0.95). In addition, exploration must be highly boosted at the beginning (\u03b50 = 1). For this setting, the resulting throughput (902.739 Mbps) represents 80.29% of the one provided by the optimal configuration that maximizes the aggregate throughput (shown in Table II). Regarding proportional fairness, the algorithm\u2019s resulting throughput is only 1.32% higher than the optimal. We also evaluate the relationship between different values of \u03b1 and \u03b3 in the average aggregate throughput and standard deviation (shown in Figure 2). We observe a remarkably higher aggregate throughput when \u03b1 > \u03b3. We also see that the variability between different simulation runs is much lower when the average throughput is higher. Additionally, we note a peak in the standard deviation when \u03b3 \u2248 \u03b1 and \u03b3 > \u03b1. To further understand the effects of modifying each of the aforementioned parameters, we show for different \u03b50, \u03b1 and \u03b3: i) the individual throughput experienced by each WN during the total 10000 iterations of a single simulation run (Figure 3),\n= 0.5 = 0.5\nii) the average throughput experienced by each WN for the last 5000 iterations, also for a single simulation run (Figure 4), and iii) the probability of choosing each action at each WN (Figure 5). We observe the following aspects:\n\u2022 In Figure 3 a high variability of the throughput experienced by each WN can be observed, specially if\n\u01eb0 is high (as in Figures 3(a), 3(c)). A high degree of exploration allows WNs to discover changes in the resulting performance of their actions due to the activity of the other nodes, which at the same time generates more variability (WN adapt to changes in the environment). \u2022 Despite the variability generated, we obtain fairer results for high \u01eb0 (Figure 4). Henceforth, there is a relationship between the variability generated and the average\nthroughput fairness.\n\u2022 Finally, in Figures 5(a) and 5(c) we observe that for the former, there are two favourite actions that are being\nplayed the most, but for the latter there is only one preferred action. The lower the learning rate (\u03b1), and consequently the discount factor (\u03b3), the higher the probability of choosing a unique action, which results to be the one that provided the best performance in the past. The opposite occurs for higher \u03b1 and \u03b3 values, since giving more importance to the immediate reward allows for a reaction only to the recently-played actions of the neighbouring nodes: the algorithm is short-sighted."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Decentralized Q-learning can be used to improve spatial reuse in dense wireless networks, enhancing performance as a result of exploiting the most rewarding actions. We have shown in this article, by means of a toy scenario, that Stateless Qlearning in particular allows finding good-performing configurations that achieve close-to-optimal (in terms of throughput maximization and proportional fairness) solutions.\nHowever, the competitiveness of the presented fullydecentralized environment involves the non-existence of a Nash Equilibrium. Thus, we have also identified high variability in the experienced individual throughput due to the constant changes of the played actions, motivated by the fact that the reward generated by each action changes according to the opponents\u2019 ones. We have evaluated the impact of the parameters intrinsic to the learning algorithm on this variability showing that it can be reduced by decreasing the exploration degree and learning rate. The individual reduction on the throughput variability occurs at the expense of losing aggregate performance.\nThis variability can potentially result in negative effects on the overall WN\u2019s performance. The effects of such a fluctuation in higher layers of the protocol stack can have severe consequences depending on the time scale at which they occur. For example, noticing high throughput fluctuations may trigger congestion recovery procedures in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which would harm the experienced performance.\nWe left for future work to further extend the decentralized approach in order to find collaborative algorithms that allow the neighbouring WNs to reach an equilibrium that grants acceptable individual performance. Acquiring any kind of knowledge about the neighbouring WNs is assumed to solve the variability issues arisen from decentralization. This information may be directly exchanged or inferred from observations. Furthermore, other learning approaches are intended\nto be analysed in the future for performance comparison in the resource allocation problem."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the Maria de Maeztu Units of Excellence Programme (MDM-2015-0502), and by the European Regional Development Fund under grant TEC2015-71303-R (MINECO/FEDER)."}], "references": [{"title": "A distributed access point selection algorithm based on no-regret learning for wireless access networks", "author": ["Chen", "May"], "venue": "In Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC 2010-Spring),", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Channel selection for networkassisted D2D communication via no-regret bandit learning with calibrated forecasting", "author": ["S.
