However, biometric authentication systems (e.g., face recognition, iris, retina, voice, and ngerprint) are increasingly facing the risk of being tricked by biometric tools such as anti-surveillance masks, contact lenses, vocoders, or ngerprint lms. In this regard, we design a multimodal biometric authentication system named DeepKey which uses both gait and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to provide be er protection against such risks. DeepKey consists of three key components: an Invalid ID Filter Model to block invalid subjects, a Gait Identi cation Model to recognize Gait IDs and an EEG Identi cation Model to recognize EEG IDs. In particular, the rst two models employ a one-class SVM algorithm and a Recurrent Neural Network based deep learning model, respectively. e third model combines autoregressive coe cients, an RNN structure, and an SVM classi er. DeepKey is trained with a gait dataset of 160,000 samples and an EEG dataset of 108,000 samples. Experimental results show DeepKey outperforms a series of comparison methods and achieves an overall accuracy of 0.983 along with an overall false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.0 and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 0.019.\nCCS Concepts: \u2022Security and privacy\u2192 Biometrics; Biometrics; \u2022Computing methodologies\u2192Machine learning algorithms;\nGeneral Terms: Gait, EEG, Biometric authentication System, Deep Learning\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: Gait, EEG, biometric authentication, multimodal, deep learning\nACM Reference format: Xiang Zhang, Lina Yao, Kaixuan Chen, Xianzhi Wang, an Z.

Such systems measure brain\u2019s response to a number of stimuli in the form of EEG signals, which record the electromagnetic, invisible, and untouchable electrical neural oscillations. Lots of research e orts have been made on EEG-based biometric authentication. For instance, Chuang et al. [8]propose a single-channel EEG-based authentication system, which achieves an accuracy of 0.99. Sarineh Keshishzadeh et al. [23] employ a statistical model for analyzing EEG signals and achieves an accuracy of 0.974. Generally, EEG signals have the following inherent advantages:\n\u2022 Uniqueness. EEG data are unique for each person and almost impossible to be cloned and duplicated. EEG signals are individual-dependent. erefore, an EEG-based authentication system has the potential to verify human identity and ingenious enough to protect against faked identities[8]. \u2022 Reliability. An EEG-based authentication system can prevent the subjects under abnormal situations\n(e.g., dramatically spiritual uctuating, hysterical, drunk, or under threaten) since EEG signals are not sensitive to human stress and mood. \u2022 Feasibility. We have seen an important trend to build authentication systems based on EEG because the\nequipment for collecting EEG data is cheap and easy to acquire, and it is expected to be more precise, accessible, and economical in the future.\nIn comparison, the gait-based authentication systems have been an active direction for years. Gait data are more generic and can be gathered easily from the popular inertial sensors. Gait data are also unique because they are determined by intrinsic factors (e.g., gender, age, height, limb length), temporal factors [6] (e.g., step length, step width, walking speed, and cycle time) and kinematic factors (e.g., joint rotation of the hip, knee, and ankle, mean joint angles of the hip/knee/ankle, and thigh/trunk/foot angles). In addition, a person\u2019s gait behavior is established inherently in long term and therefore di cult to be faked. Hoang et al. [20] propose a gait-based authentication biometric system to analyze the gait data gathered by mobile device, adopt error correcting codes to process the variation in gait measurement and nally achieve a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 3.92% and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 11.76%. Cola et al. [9] collect wrist signals and train gait pa erns to detect invalid subjects (authenticated people). e proposed method achieves an EER (equal error rate) of 2.9%.\nAlthough both the Gait-based and EEG-based authentication systems have promising characteristics, all those systems face the threat of being deceived as a result of the rapidly development of manufacturing industry and technologies. For example, people can easily trick a ngerprint-based authentication system by using a fake ngerprint lm 1 or an expensive face recognition-based authentication systems by simply wearing a 200 dollars\u2019 worth anti-surveillance mask 2. Besides, various other challenges still remain: (i) the performance of the gait-based authentication system does not scaled well with the increase in the number of authorized subjects [42]; (ii) many biometric authentication systems are working on a single modality, the FAR of which is higher than 0.03. It is not precise enough for high degree con dential places such as military bases, the treasuries of banks and political o ces which require an authentication system with high precision since any tiny misjudge will provoke great economic or political catastrophes; (iii) the authentication system may result in wrong decisions if disturbed by the environmental factors.\nIn this paper, we propose a two-factor biometric authentication system, DeepKey, which enables the dualauthentication to leverage the advantages of both the gait-based and the EEG-based systems. Compared with either gait-based or EEG-based authentication system, the two-factor authentication system o ers more reliable and precise identi cation. Table 1 summarizes the overall comparison of DeepKey with some representative works on 7 key aspects. DeepKey consists of three main components: the Invalid ID Filter Model to eliminate invalid or outlier targets; the Gait Identi cation Model to identify targets\u2019 gait IDs; and the EEG Identi cation Model\n1h p://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Fool-a-Fingerprint-Security-System-As-Easy-/ 2h p://www.urmesurveillance.com/urme-prosthetic/\nACM J.

Our main contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows:\n\u2022 We present DeepKey, a dual-authentication system that exploits both gait and EEG biological traits. To the best of our knowledge, DeepKey is the rst two-factor authentication system which combines EEG and gait signals for person authentication. To further enhance the performance, DeepKey includes an Invalid ID Filter Model that achieves a FAR of 0 to eliminate impostors with 100% security guaranteed. \u2022 We design a robust recurrent neural network that simultaneously detection and classi cation of multi-\nmodal sensor data, to decode the large diversity in how people perform gaits and how people perform brain activities. \u2022 Together a cropped training strategy, Orthogonal Array Experiment Method, we validate and evaluate\nDeepKey on real-datasets. Our results show that DeepKey signi cantly outperforms a series of baseline models and the-state-of-the-art methods, achieving a FAR of 0 and a FRR of 0.019.\nNote that all the necessary reusable codes and datasets in this paper have been open-sourced for reproduction, please refer to this link. 3 e remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Currently, the most mature biometric authentication technology is ngerprint-based authentication which has been demonstrated to high matching accuracy and been used for decades [32]. Iris recognition is another popular approach for biometric authentication owing to its unique and stable pa ern [39]. In 1993, Daugman [10] proposes to use Gabor phase information and Hamming distance for iris code matching, which still is the most classic iris recognition method. Based on [10], a urry of research [39] has emerged o ering solutions to ameliorate iris authentication problems. For example, Pillai et al.

Face recognition techniques [12, 18, 53] are the most common used and accepted by the public for its unique features and non-intrusiveness. Since face recognition systems require tackling di erent challenges including expression, image quality, illumination, and disguise to achieve high accuracy, infrared (IR) [18] and 3D [12] systems have a racted much a ention. According to [53], multimodal recognition combining traditional visual textual features and IR or 3D systems can achieve higher accuracy than single modal systems."}, {"heading": "2.2 Gait based authentication", "text": "As the most basic activity in our daily lives, walking is an advanced research hotspot for activity recognition [21, 36, 51]. Di ering from previous work, our work focuses on human gait, a spatiotemporal biometric that measures a person\u2019s manner on walking. On the one hand, gait can be collected remotely without human interaction when compared with other aforementioned biometric features [47]. On the other hand, it is challenging to eliminate the in uence of exterior factors including clothing, walking surface, shoes, carrying stu , and other environmental factors. Existing gait recognition approaches sit in two categories. One is model-based approach [38], which models gait information with a mathematical structures, and the other is appearance-based approach, which extracts features in a straightforward way irrespective of the mathematical structure. Due to its high e ciency and remarkable performance, Gait Energy Image (GEI) [33] has become one of the most popular appearance-based methods in recent years. Based on GEIs, Guan et al. [16] employ a Random Subspace Method (RSM) [19] and model the in uence of exterior factors as the unknown partial feature corruption to decrease the in uence. With the prevalence of WiFi devices, WiFiU [48], a method utilizing two WiFi devices to extract discriminating gait features is proposed. To address the challenges of distinguishing di erent body parts and representing walking pa erns, the system generates spectrograms and conduct enhancing process and autocorrelation on the contour pro le. Besides, the cross-view variance is also a concern of gait identi cation [27, 28]. For example, Wu et al. [49] consider not only the cross-view variance but also deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for robust gait identi cation."}, {"heading": "2.3 EEG based authentication", "text": "Since EEG can be gathered in a safe and non-intrusive way, researchers have paid great a ention to exploring this kind of brain signals.

Publication date: March 2017."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "Biometric authentication involves various technologies to identify individuals by exploiting their unique, measurable physiological and behavioral characteristics. However, biometric authentication systems (e.g., face recognition, iris, retina, voice, and \u0080ngerprint) are increasingly facing the risk of being tricked by biometric tools such as anti-surveillance masks, contact lenses, vocoders, or \u0080ngerprint \u0080lms. In this regard, we design a multimodal biometric authentication system named DeepKey which uses both gait and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to provide be\u008aer protection against such risks. DeepKey consists of three key components: an Invalid ID Filter Model to block invalid subjects, a Gait Identi\u0080cation Model to recognize Gait IDs and an EEG Identi\u0080cation Model to recognize EEG IDs. In particular, the \u0080rst two models employ a one-class SVM algorithm and a Recurrent Neural Network based deep learning model, respectively. \u008ce third model combines autoregressive coe\u0081cients, an RNN structure, and an SVM classi\u0080er. DeepKey is trained with a gait dataset of 160,000 samples and an EEG dataset of 108,000 samples. Experimental results show DeepKey outperforms a series of comparison methods and achieves an overall accuracy of 0.983 along with an overall false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.0 and a false rejection rate (FRR) of 0.019.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
