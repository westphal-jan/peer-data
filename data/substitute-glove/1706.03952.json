Each sentence is characterized by distinct F0 patterns that are perceived as different melodies, such as questions, statements, commands, and requests. The purpose of this study is to provide a classification model of Cypriot Greek statements and questions, using information from their fundamental frequency (F0) contours (for a description of Cypriot Greek intonation see Themistocleous, 2011, 2016). To this purpose two different neural network architectures were tested: a Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and a convolutional neural network (ConvNet)."}, {"heading": "Properties of Tonal Contours", "text": "In statements with broad focus, each phonological word associates with rising and falling tunes; the whole melody starts usually at a higher frequency and declines gradually to a lower frequency (see Figure 1 upper right panel). By contrast, Wh-questions are characterized either by sustained tune at a high frequency (see Figure 1 upper left panel) or by high-low tune at the Wh-word followed by a fall and an optional rise at the end of the utterance (Figure 1 lower panel). Notably, the automatic classification of intonation is challenging as tonal contours can differ depending on linguistic\nand non-linguistic factors including the segmental structure of utterances, the distribution of lexical stresses, the speech rate, and the physiology of speakers (gender, age, etc.). These factors affect the overall structure of tonal patterns, such as the frequency range and the length of the utterance."}, {"heading": "Artificial Network Architectures", "text": "LSTMs are recurrent neural architectures (RNN) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), which proved to be extremely powerful and dynamical systems in recognizing, processing, and predicting tasks such as time series, which are characterized by time lags of unknown size and bound between important events (Schmidhuber, Wierstra and Gomez, 2005). LSTMs displayed a strong record for addressing problems in speech recognition (Graves, et al. 2013), rhythm learning (Gers, Schraudolph, and Schmidhuber, 2002) etc. However, a disadvantage of using LSTMs (and RNNs in general) is that they are slower with respect to feed-forward networks; such as convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). ConvNets are feed-forward\nartificial neural networks, which learn patterns in restricted regions a.k.a., receptive fields that partially overlap. These architectures were inspired by biological processes of visual perception. These architectures were successfully employed to address tasks in image recognition (Ciresan, Meier, and Schmidhuber, 2012) and sentence processing."}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "For the purposes of this study, 1966 statement productions were produced by 25 female speakers and 2860 Wh-questions were produced by 20 female speakers of Cypriot Greek. Sound files were segmented and labelled and the corresponding F0 contours were extracted every 12.5 ms. The data was then padded with zeros for a total length of 1024 and provided as an input to our models. Statements consisted of the same utterance melody \u201cipes CVCV pali\u201d you said CVCV again, where C stands for a consonant and V for a vowel whereas Wh questions varied both in length and in the initial Whword. For the purposes of this study a twofold experiment has been employed, namely a classification task with an LSTM neural network and a classification task with a ConvNet.\nFigure 3. Examples of learned convolutional filters for the first layer."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We have described two artificial neural network architectures: an LSTM and a convolutional network. The ConvNet outperformed the LSTM in accuracy and speed. Specifically, the ConvNet achieves high performance on question and statement classification without requiring external features, such as manually tagged pitch accents. The network can identify by itself the properties of the tonal contour that are most significant for the classification. Despite the high accuracy learned features are not easily interpreted from a linguistic point of view (see Figure 3), yet a promising aspect of this architecture is that it requires few parameters (only 6 filters). However, this study was performed on a corpus that exhibits regularities and it remains to be seen whether it generalizes in a more varied corpus.\nReferences Ciresan, D., Meier, U., Schmidhuber, J. 2012.
